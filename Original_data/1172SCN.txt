yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in a n~ in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ
