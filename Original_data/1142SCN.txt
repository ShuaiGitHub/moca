water tight and sometimes they weren't . and um . 
the ah . canoeing . was always a matter of ah . some competition to .
get the canoes . out and about . and ah . we put sails on them . and ah
canoes aren't very stable with sails but ah . we did our best and . 
sometimes acutally had to put a bag of sand in the bottom in order to keep them
upright for a little bit longer but then of course when the
. you roll over with the bag of sand then you went to the bottom .

 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often ur~ urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
