he's nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a 
pronounced feeling of the utmost respect twice each day he plays skilfully 
and with zest upon a small organ except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . father likes to be modern in his language
