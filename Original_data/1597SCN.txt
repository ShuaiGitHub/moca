Simon: alright now could I get you to tell me about something funny or amusing that happened to you or even a friend when you were growing up - - 

1597SCN: I hate these sort of <> things . I've always been amazed about people who can remember or the worst day in your life . or or whatever
because I I'm er my mind has always a blank about things like . that . um . you haven't got another topic? 

Simon:  or any sort any sort of s~ it doesn't have to be amusing . any sort of story or anything you can remember from childhood or school . 

1597SCN: oh . um . okay um . that broadens it a little bit doesn't it er yeah - well I'll tell you about my grandfather . <f~ alright> yes 
so my grandfather we're my grandfather and grandmother came . out from England to take us out of the orphanage 
seeing my father wasn't doing the considerate thing after four or five years of getting married and providing us with a new step mother . 
so they came out and and of course they were I was . so we left the orphanage on the twenty second of . December nineteen forty six . 
and um . these were two totally new people to us we'd never seen them before . and um . grandad . was a lovely kind man but there were times when . 
he was . he'd brush you away almost physically away . so we learnt . to sort of um - put up feelers I suppose um before we went to grandad
um I remember one time he showed me how to plant parsnips he got his um . er . papers for his cigarettes . and he'd put three seeds in one 
because apparently they don't have a high germination rate . so . that was the first time I'd heard the word germination . 
 with regard to seeds . and um . he would be very kind and he w~ he would he bought a totally different aspect to us 
gran of course just you know . was doing the housework and . and trying to run . three . grandchildren and her . um . 
away with the fairies at times son . and her as it turned out . as we didn't find out until . years after grandad died which he did when I was eight . 
that he was an alcoholic . and the reason why . we had to put feelers was because he was on a bender and we didn't even recognise the spell~ smell
so when grandad had been on a bender well was . er that . he was . er a completely different man . <right> and um . 
I've often thought that . and when I was a social worker about kids who have to put up feelers around . 
um peculiar members of their <mmm> family or dysfunctional members of their family then it kind of helped me to . 
to be able to . talk with them . about such things you know <right> that were because I mean most of the time grandad was fine . 
you know <mmm mmm> um do you want me to keep on talking about this <no> . 

Simon: <> that's absolutely fine thank you <okay> very much for that 

1597SCN: alright 

Simon: okay er . now . er what did you have for breakfast this morning? . 

1597SCN: I had my own home made muesli which has got twelve different things cos I have a policy of thinking that . um they don't really totally know about food
so if I try to eat as many things varieties of things in a day <> that I can . I try to get to twenty five different foods . 
things <oh right> er in a day . including water of course and coffee . and wine . 

Simon: <> very good <yeah> ticking all the boxes <and I had and a . yeah> 

1597SCN: and I had um I had a big . mug of tea 

Simon: <> oh very good . oh right . okay so we're nearly finished . are you okay? 

1597SCN: I'm fine 

Simon: good so now as I mentioned I've got this passage for you to read . now it's not a test of reading skill so if you do wanna look through it first 
that's fine but when you're ready you can read that out loud - 

1597SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever good on him . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice a day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk~ . walk more and smoke less . but he always answers 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language . in his language . < > banana oil 

Simon: <> yes no just about everyone I've come across . has the same reaction but then I had a Canadian lady who um . read it 
and she's like oh she's like my grandad says that all the time . <oh okay so it be> so it must be an American thing <yes> 

1597SCN: presumably a Jewish thing . 

Simon:  . alright er now we've finished the recording er it went okay didn't it?

1597SCN: mmm hmm mmm

Simon: er so which test have you found the hardest? - -
