1621SCN: er . okay . um . right - the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather well . 
he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as s~ swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in a . old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing - a long beard clings to his chin - giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he sl~ . slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil - grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
