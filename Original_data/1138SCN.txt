1138SCN:  . the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock clock coat .
usually with several buttons missing a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ .
except in winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
