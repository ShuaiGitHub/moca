I went to the Kent educational authority to get a grant to go to training college 
and I walked into the room and there was a table with ten men sitting there looking at me 
and I sat down and I got through this interview and answered the questions as well as I could 
and then I went to leave and I opened the door to go out not one of the men opened the door 
and I found myself in a cupboard 
<oh> and I thought I've got to get through here somehow there must be a way out 
and then this deep voice said you are in the cupboard

1431SCN: the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
