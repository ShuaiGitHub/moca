in those days and ah - so ah you we had a time 
might have been during the week it certainly can't have been everyday 
when we were allowed to change our library books 
and so I expect - somebody was chosen to go up and change a book .
and then would call out a name of an~ another child who could then 
go up and change their library book .

1477SCN: -- 
oh righto - 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer (Anne): thank you - so we've finished the recording . that went okay didn't it?
