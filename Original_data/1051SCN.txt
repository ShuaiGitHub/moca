TRANSCRIPT

Interviewer 1051SCN: . so participant number . one zero five one S C N 
the date today second of August two thousand and ten . 

1051SCN: I don't have to remember that number ?
<no> I didn't even catch it I~ I would only ever write numbers down .
the very good reason that a numbers no use unless you've got it accurately .
um <right> . ringing the r~ wrong phone number is no good . um . 
and go to computer of course . um absolutely no good . so .
for this reason I don't try to remember numbers . unless they're short . 
but I do find with . working in Belfast
I don't even remember the first three digits three two three cos that's universal for Belfast 
same thing for Kiapoi . where I moved just the three two seven . so I cut down the . 
what I call the useless number <laughs> and . remember the la~ next four numbers so I get
them right until I um . 'til I can write them in my diary or I can write them .
on the palm of my hand so . um it's just a way of . not giving myself an impossible .
number to remember 

Interviewer 1051SCN: yip . ok . cool alright so . so it's all being recorded now 

1051SCN: yes 

Interviewer 1051SCN: um so what I need you to do is to count to ten .

1051SCN: one . two . three . four . five . six . seven . eight . nine . ten . 

Interviewer 1051SCN: cool . ah now can you tell me a early childhood memory .

1051SCN: an early childhood memory <mmm> my sister going into 
Christchurch hosptial . for an eye operation - 
she . was I think started primary school so say five or six and I'm three years behind her .
and remember walking back past the . Avon river and seeing little yellow ducks .

Interviewer 1051SCN: oh right . oh excellent . 

1051SCN: an another early
memory and I can't put a time on it except that it was before . nineteen . fourty three . 
my father's in the home guard . and ah he had another man in the house . 
ah also in army uniform . and he was showing me the question . how . um .
a tall person . a kid . leaning down his arms between his knees and if he got it right 
you could actually flip the kid up and he said don't try this at home cos you'll break
their neck . I'd probably been over five at that stage but the one about 
the young ducks I was well under five .

Interviewer 1051SCN: right oh wow . so it is quite early then 

1051SCN: well yip <yip> other things round the farm . they they had no particular . 
time scale se~ sequence but I've always had that particular one of the fluffy ducks .

Interviewer 1051SCN: hmm . thank you . ok ah what did you have for breakfast . 

1051SCN: my usual weetbix and tamarillos . ah and then later on . 
after I'd fed the horses ah . toast honey with blackcurrant jam . and cup 'a' tea .

Interviewer 1051SCN: and what do you like best for breakfast .

1051SCN: my weet bix is the main thing . um . weetbix hot milk .
um and same thing when I went to stay for a month with my daughter in London . um . 
and I took over blackcurrant jam and took over New Zealand honey ah sorry bl~ the a~ .
weetbix ha~ weetbix hot milk on and honey goes on and I took it over 
. two jars of um bush honey .
um one for her and one for me for me f~ and used up mine in the whole time I was there 
um and even when we went to Germany um I found the same sorta similar thing like weetbix 
was avaliable at the Tesco's shop across the road so took box of . 
over there the hardest part was to get the hot milk . ah h~
in a German ra~ cafe inside that 
an~ y~ hot milk what they they had to just bearly warmed it
inside that's who worked out one particular place we we double head cos we put a 
<laughs> put in thing we put steam through it so got the wa~ . got the milk hot enough 
like that . it was hot enough to do two or three weetbix not four . 
<laugh> then the honey went on and the honey melts over it and things like that 
um it could set me up for the whole day that one actually .

Interviewer 1051SCN: cool . alright . ok well we're nearly finished . so a~ are you ok?

1051SCN: yeah yeah that's alright .

Interviewer 1051SCN: ok so for this one could you read this sen~ ah passage out aloud 
now it's not a test of reading skills so you might like to look at it first 
and then just let me know when you are ready to read that aloud - - 

1051SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well . he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -

Interviewer 1051SCN: cool .

1051SCN: interesting ma~ <alright> yeah interesting passage yeah 

Interviewer 1051SCN: alright we're done 

1051SCN: I can identify with someone that age 
I'm not a grandfather yet though . 

Interviewer 1051SCN: cool so th~ . that went ok didn't it .

1051SCN: I don't mind <cool> yeah it didn't hurt 

Interviewer 1051SCN: cool . ah and so which test was the hardest then - 

1051SCN: um - - commiting to memory the number knowing I was going to have to repeat it . 

Interviewer 1051SCN: mmm

1051SCN: it was only - I think five digits - the . letters backwards . 
was a snip cos there were only three - 
and I had the lingering fear I was going to have to repeat 
them some stage before we finished 
because I think they're gone compleatly the letters and the numbers . yeah .
