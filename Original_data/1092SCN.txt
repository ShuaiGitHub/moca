Interviewer 1092SCN: ah now can you tell me about an early childhood memory - 

1092SCN: one of my lasting childhood memories is in nineteen forty seven . in Wales when it snowed very heavily . 
to such an extent that the wind blew the snow off the . sides of the field and made .
ah like mushroom shapes and I was able to stand under them with my father . 

Interviewer 1092SCN: oh right . oh that's pretty cool - well sort of how how . deep was the snow then ? 

1092SCN: well i~ i~ i~ . I don't know if you n~ y~ you know w~ Wales or Devon but the roads . through usage are considerably below the level of the field 
<oh right> they've sort of been worn worn worn down . so if the snow blows off the field it's actually up in the air <oh> 
and b~ it was cold as well as snowy . so you'd get these h~ I mean a lot . and it's just . magic to a kid I was like four or something you know
 yeah <excellent> 

Interviewer 1092SCN: all right cool could you ah tell me anything else from around that time or a little about your family maybe ? 

1092SCN: well at the same time there were there were two other incidences that I distinctly remember the milk bottles having the milk standing up .
out of them because of the cold <oh yip> and the tops which were cardboard . n~ not ah metal .
ah were just sitting on the top of this colummn of . of like milky ice that was just sticking out of them . 
and then um my father who was a school teacher the school was closed . ah and there were no traffic on the roads or anything it was that bad so he .
took me on a sleigh . all the way to my grandmother's house which was like . two miles away pulling me 
on on this this sleigh and I remember that these are very early . 
memories you know y~ you see but they're all abou~ I've told you things about that same time . <yip cool> 
I don't know <excellent> is that enough <yes that's fine thank you> .

Interviewer 1092SCN: okay - what did you have for breakfast ? 

1092SCN: I don't eat breakfast 

Interviewer 1092SCN: all right cool well the next question was gonna be what do you like best for breakfast 

1092SCN: well what I used to eat as a kid was it was bread and marmalade . bread and butter and marmalade . 
so that would have been a breakfast <yip> but I haven't eaten a breakfast oh I know you're supposed to . I read all the books about it 
but I don't 

Interviewer 1092SCN: no that's fine . right so we're nearly finished . you okay . it's going all right . <yip> cool . just got this final passage for you to read here 
so again it's not a test of reading skill so feel free to look over it if you like straight into it .

1092SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his . language <excellent> 
my father used to play on a small organ actually it it it echoes him but he didn't wear a long black frock coat <excellent thank you> 

Interviewer 1092SCN: all right so we're done <great> so that went okay didn't it <yip> excellent . and ah so which test was the hardest ? 

1092SCN: the the the remembering the complex geometrical drawing <mm> . um th~ that . I was in a distinct place of knowing I was wrong but not being able to t~
to recover it if you like you know <yip excellent>
