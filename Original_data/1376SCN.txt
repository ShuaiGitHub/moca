difference you found . 

1376SCN: well Dunedin I found the further south you go the more friendly the people are 
<mmm> you come down to Christchurch they become very conservative . um .
they like to think they're very English I don't know wheather that's
reflection on the on the English or not . 
but it was much harder to make friends than Christchurch than in was in Dunedin . 
ah . but having said that ah -
yeah I would suggest that most of friends I've made in Christchurch infact aren't Christchurch people
they have come to Christchurch from else where <mmm> . wheather that's a reflection on . 
yeah outsiders sticking together or coming together I don't know 

Interviewer 1376SCN: I I've found the same thing yeah <mmm> um .

1376SCN: yes . 

Interviewer 1376SCN: now could you please read this passage . it's not a test of reading skill
so you might like to look at it first 
and let me know when you're ready to read it aloud - - 

1376SCN: yes I think we can start <mmm hmm> 
 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a walk 
 in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer 1376SCN: great well we're finished the recording . it went ok didn't it? .

1376SCN: yes <s~> I hope so 

Interviewer 1376SCN: so which so which test have you found the hardest? . -
drawing the ah . yes the things from memory 

1376SCN: that is a nasty one . um I'll just 
repeating cos I think I might have spoken too quietly earlier but
this is one three seven six S C N on the thirtith of June
