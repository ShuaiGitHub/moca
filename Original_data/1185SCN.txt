well he is n~ nearly ninety three years old .
he is still as swift as ever . he dresses himself in an old black fruit frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
early in the winter - when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk .
in the open air each day - we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answered banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
