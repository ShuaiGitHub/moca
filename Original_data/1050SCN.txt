well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with th~ with zest 
upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to s~ walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
