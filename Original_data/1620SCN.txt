and um . in the midlands . and . we had this enormous house they had three children . and . it was just my mum and me . 
who went over to England cos my dad was <mmm> killed in the war you see so we'd gone over to see <oh I'm sorry mmm> my father's family . and um

it had er . the office . solicitors office downstairs <yip> and a dining room . and then there was um - - er . a lounge that you went up
half a storey <mmm> that was sort of our away from the main part of the house - er and then you went up to the m~ . bedroom one er above the lounge .

and let me know when you're ready to read it aloud - - 

1620SCN:  banana oil . that's gorgeous haha okay <yip> - right . the grandfather passage - you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . 
banana oil - grandfather likes to be modern . in his language .

JW: thank you . well . 

1620SCN: where's that from? .
