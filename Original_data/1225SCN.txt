you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
