1231SCN: um - when we lived in Picton . and I was a child . er we used to go down to . what . they call the foreshore . 
don't know what they call it now but it was a . really nice play area with - with boat swings and . er . 
slides and all that kind of thing soexcellent . I actually spent a few years in Blenheim so we were going across to Picton quite a lot . 
and <mmm> I just always remember going down to those - the playground there . and they had a wee um . 
the wee pond . we used to be able to . um sail the wee . yachts you could hire . <oh > 
that was always a favourite I'm not sure if that's still there now but when I was . a kid that was definitely there it was awesome .

1231SCN:  mmm hmm .

Interviewer 1231SCN: alright . so as I mentioned we've got this um . just a short paragraph you have to read . it's not a test of reading skill . 
er so feel free to look through it first if you like . and when you're ready just read that aloud . 

1231SCN:  mmm - - you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he's nearly now ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old . black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ - except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - we have often urged him to work . walk more and smoke less but he always answers . 
 banana oil - grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer 1231SCN: alright thank you . alright so we're done now . <> so that went okay didn't it?

you know . relatively . structured and - er - but in the end I . there were . you know . once . once I started trying to remember the 
harder it . seemed to . just . <> like like trying to remember a dream 

Interviewer 1231SCN: alright yes . oh <mmm> that's a good way to put it .
