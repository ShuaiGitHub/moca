he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing - 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost ex~ respect - 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air every day - 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
