and the car wouldn't start .

you know he's got this old car and he offered us a ride and then the car wouldn't even start

1421SCN: the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons . missing 
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day . he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
I've never heard of banana oil <no>
