as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself . in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those . who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest . upon a small organ .
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day -
we have often urged him . to walk . more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
