1578SCN:  oh yeah it'll be alright hmm <okay?> . the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents him . oh prevents sorry . he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
