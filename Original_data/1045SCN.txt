and my father owned a business and it burnt down . 
and he decleared there a spark had come out of the fire .

1045SCN:  - -  
gran~ the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who absorb 
observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air
each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil
. grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
