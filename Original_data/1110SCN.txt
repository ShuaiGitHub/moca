and I had a terrible terrible terrible tummy ache . 
and the doctor . we lived in the south of Holland close to the Belgium 
boarder <ah ok> and the doctor had to come from Belgium <ah>
across the river <oh yes> on his bike to us I never now how he was contacted 
because nobody had a telephone but some how . anyway the doctor was there . 
and then the next thing I know I was . put into a black . 
taxi . car . <mmm> and weren't many taxis or cars in the village <yeah> in those days .
and I was taken to the hospital . <oh> and . then 
the other thing I remember is that I was in a room . 
and there were glass bottles . whether they were for urine samples or what ever can't remember
. and then after that I was put . in . on one of the wards . 
and there were beds in a row . and . across from me . was .
a little boy and he had his leg sort of .
