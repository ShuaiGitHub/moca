Interviewer 1545SCN: never had a grandfather quite like that . 

1545SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly . ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents it he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him . to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
