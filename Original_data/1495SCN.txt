Interviewer 1495SCN: that's absolutely fine . 

1495SCN: she was in . a band . in North America and she played the base drum - 
and it was high school . as a teenager you're sensitive and
they marched out of the ice rink before the hockey game . 
up a hill and she slid . and fell and rolled over her drum
and she and her drum and her little white majorette boots
rolled all the way back into the rink . and she thought
that was the worst most horrible thing that could ever happen to her
and since she'd survived it she's never worry about anything again 
 I thought that was a wonderful message to take

1495SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he th~ still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
banana oil is modern in his language
