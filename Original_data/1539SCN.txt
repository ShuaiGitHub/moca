yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully . with zest upon a small organ except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often h~ urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
 I've never heard of banana oil that's good <no>
