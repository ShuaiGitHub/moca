1574SCN:  <ok> right .
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually . with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small or~ organ .
except in the winter when the snow or i~ ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1574SCN: great oh we've finished the recording that went ok didn't it? 

1574SCN: I think so 

Interviewer 1574SCN: and so . um which test have you found the hardest? .
