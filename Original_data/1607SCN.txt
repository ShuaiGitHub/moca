yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the i~ snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
