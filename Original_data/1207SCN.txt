on radio which I think was about half past seven it was unheard of 
for me not to have to go to sleep before then 
and ah the lone ranger had this wonderful background music List and 
the prelude and and ah the daduh daduh daduh 
Versini Versini and ah . List were the two composers 
and it ruined my appreciation of that music forever because I only see it th~ th~ the
masked man riding off on his horse

1207SCN: okay . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of u~ the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with the zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and sloke less smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language 
but my granddaughter says it's now random . the latest fashion --
