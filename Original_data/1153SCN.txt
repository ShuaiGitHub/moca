Interviewer 1153SCN: alright . now can you tell me about an early happy childhood memory .

1153SCN: an early happy childhood memory - - um it has to be quite early does it 

Interviewer 1153SCN: earliesh . 

1153SCN:  - goodness - - 
o~ a~ m~ but but in general terms or does it have to be a specific thing that you want

Interviewer 1153SCN: ah entirely up to you 

1153SCN: entirely up to me . well I suppose I always liked swimming . 
and so . going to the beach was always very very happy I loved going to the beach
. ah sort of dancing up and down in the waves . um . I can remember . 
one time . going to . Prince Edward island . and there was a sand bar . 
and a lot of p~ it was a big beach and I was about nine I think .
and my father . was swimming and he he loved the water too 
everybody was in the water . but he wanted to go to the sand bar .
where a lot of p~ a lot of adults we standing and I really couldn't swim that well .
and so he told me not to follow him . you see . 
but I tried to follow him and of course I got over my head and began going down so . 
can't say this is a happy childhood memory <laugh> but it's a very vivid one
because he came back and he was quite cross and he pushed me . 
over my head and so I did go up and down a bit . and then he said .
now you know that you have to learn to swim . so as a result of that . 
we returned to . Halifax where I lived . and we were . in in this um 
sort of club . wh~ . they had swimming lessons 
and I can remember going down . 
in very cold water and just practicing and practicing til I could swim over my head
and I did that . cos I was just stubborn and I wanted to 
<laugh> you know I wanted to I didn't want to be pushed over my head any more
so it was a happy childhood memory in that I remember .
a~ setting myself a goal and actually doing it 
because there was practically no one else in the water and I can remember being quite cold .
<right> and when I say quite cold I mean . it certainly wasn't sixty it must have been you know
w~ we're talking ferinheight here ah <laugh>
it was about fifty eight it was chilly <right> but I I did manage

Interviewer 1153SCN: excellent <something> oh very good I remember <yeah> at 
school we had a swimming pool in the school and . 
we were only allowed to go down the deep end if we could swim or had <yeah> to pass a swimming
lesson I remember <yeah> the only reason I learnt to swim was so I could go in the deep end 
<I know> with everyone else <exactly>

1153SCN: <laugh> and I wanted to be able to swim up to the 
sand bar the next time but we've never been back there

Interviewer 1153SCN: oh right <yeah> . yes and ah thank you for that 
. ok . what did you have for breakfast this morning? .

1153SCN: cherrios and orange juice that's an easy one <laugh>
since I have cherrios and orange juice every morning .

Interviewer 1153SCN: oh right . and what do you like best for breakfast? . 

1153SCN: cherrios <unknown> no I like porridge best really .
but I don't have porridge in the summer so cherrios are second best .

Interviewer 1153SCN: ok cool . ah right so we're nearly finished . <mmm> are you ok?

1153SCN: mmm hmm .

Interviewer 1153SCN: cool . right now so I've got this passage for you to read finally <mmm>
now it's not a test of reading skill or anything like that 
<yeah> so feel free to look through it first . 
and when you're ready just read that aloud .

1153SCN: I'll just read it ok 
the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1153SCN:  excellent <laugh> thank you very much 

1153SCN: you're welcome 

Interviewer 1153SCN: alright so we're done 

1153SCN: we're done

Interviewer 1153SCN: so that went ok didn't it <yeah> 

1153SCN: yeah no that was that was very interesting really

Interviewer 1153SCN: ah so ah which test was the hardest .

1153SCN: well . I think the one a~ e~ o~ was copying that last diagram was a bit of a nuisance
<oh right yes> didn't like that one . um . 
no I'm just trying to think which was the hardest .
I suppose I was more shaken by the fact that you were going to ask me those words .
<right> daisy red church velvet face .
ah again and I thought there would be more of them 
<right ok> and it was kind of like having those memory tests .
at a at a party where they present you with a tray . 
<oh yes> and you're spose to remember all the objects but they usually put about 
fifteen on and I can ever only get thirteen <laugh> or something you know
. so um . but the a~ but I thought you'd ask me more about .
um . things to remember that things would average people would remember 
<right> for example the names of prime ministers .
but the funny thing was somebody had told me about the seven .
out they ask you to subtract from seven <oh right oh right> from a hundred 
they said that was . 
s~ a~ it was y~ ages ago somebody said that was the standard test for Alzheimer's 
and a it was seven . yeah <interesting> so that was an easy one 
v~ well they were all reasonably easy aren't they yeah good mmm
