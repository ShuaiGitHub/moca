Interviewer 1015SCN: now tell me about an early childhood memory --

1015SCN: um . when I . was eighteen months old my mother went to the sanatorium with T B . 
she went to Waipiata --
and I went to live with my aunt in Invercargill who has six children the youngest one of those was ten --
and . I can remember so many things that happened during that time . 
i~ because it was i~ so different from anything I'd experienced before <mm> .
like . aunty Ray putting me to bed one afternoon and there was a cat in the bed <mm>
she didn't know whose it was and it . jumped out and jumped out the window but that was okay .
and I can remember when uncle Willy usd to come home at night from work I used to go up to y~ his bedroom <mm> -
before he came home .
which was along a big dark hall and into a very dark bedroom .
and grovel around in the wardrobe til I found his slippers .
and then bring them out and put them by the fire for him - 
that's quite funny <mm> and another thing from that time I can remember is . 
aunty Ray had some . visitors for afternoon tea . ladies they were .
and she must have had crumby cake or something because after~ it must have been in the winter too because afterward they all got up 
and shook their skirts in the fireplace -
ah . yeah .
and I can just remember the boys who were much . 
older and much bigger than me of course cos they were the oldest ones in the family <mm> throwing me up to the ceiling oh I just used to love that

Interviewer 1015SCN: well thank you um -

1015SCN: two boiled eggs <boiled eggs> .

Interviewer 1015SCN: mm and what do you like best for breakfast? 

1015SCN: two boiled eggs <two boiled> . 
but I h~ I actually chuck out the yolk sometimes <oh do you> of the second one yeah cos yolks are supposed not to be good for you .
ever since I was quite young I've had -- eggs <mm> yeah . for breakfast .

Interviewer 1015SCN: well we're nearly finished are you okay? <yeah yeah> 
ah could you please . read this passage 
it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first . just let me know when you are ready to read it aloud --
-- 

1015SCN: mm . okay -- 
the grandfather passage
you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost est~ respect
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 
 that's a good wee story 

Interviewer 1015SCN: well we're done . that went okay didn't it <yeah> 

1015SCN: yeah it's fine 

Interviewer 1015SCN: so which test was the hardest? .

1015SCN: I didn't find any of them hard .
excepting the drawing ones maybe the second drawing one with th~ the~ all the lines in it
