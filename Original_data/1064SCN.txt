Interviewer 1064SCN: thank you . ah now can you tell me about an early childhood memory - - 

1064SCN: right . you made me think of my grandfather . and - 
just . within the last fifteen years I've studied the family history . 
and our . name ancestor is lost . 
and it reminded me . 
that when I was very young I sat on my grandfather's knee . 
and I could smell the tabacco because he was a pipe smoker . 
plus he rolled his own . 
from the packet of tabacco 
and I remember looking up at him . and saying . 
what's that hole in your cheek grandfather and he gave a mischievous look at my grandmother .
over beside the coal stove . and said oh .
Lizzy Lizzy got cross and stuck me in the face 
with a needle and my grandmother just gave him a look .
and um . said absolutely nothing . but .
I've think I remember the point of the story . 
the point of the story was I said to him . 
sitting on his knee . what was your grandfather like . 
and he looked at me and he said . very stern .
children were to sit at the table . say nothing .
they were to be seen and not heard . 
so . I had no clues from my grandparents they . were very mum .
about their parents and their grandparents and you just got general comments .
nothing that would give you any clues when you grew up and tried to think . <mmm>
what might lead you . mmm . 

Interviewer 1064SCN: ok excellent thank you . ok . ah what did you have for breakfast this morning -

Interviewer 1064SCN:  excellent . and what do you like best for breakfast - 

1064SCN: probably that . plus . toast and marmalade 

Interviewer 1064SCN: oh yum . alright . so nearly finished . are you ok?

1064SCN: yip

Interviewer 1064SCN: cool . alright finally I've just got this passage for you to read out . and again .
it's not a test of reading skills so feel free to look over it and things like that 
when you're ready just jump on in . and read it aloud 

1064SCN: I'm a school teacher you see . I've got a yakking to my friends voice
and I've got a reading <laugh> to the class voice . so - - 
the grandfather passage 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer 1064SCN: excellent . well thank you very much . alright so we're done .
