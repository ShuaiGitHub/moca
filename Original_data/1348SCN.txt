1348SCN: the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks swif~ . as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black 
frock coat usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - -
