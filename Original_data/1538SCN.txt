 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes short walks a short walk 
 in the open air each day . we have often -

 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
