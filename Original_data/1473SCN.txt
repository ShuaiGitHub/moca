well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving thosed who observe him . 
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language oh good on him
