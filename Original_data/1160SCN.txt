as the other fathers did but and the the mo~ the three women . 
always took frying pans and the fresh fish would be . 
cooked on an open fire at the picnic .

beautiful flavour of those lovely fresh fish and then as children we were all expected .

1160SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well .
he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
