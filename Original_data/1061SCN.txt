and my mother sent me round the corner to get milk . 
and I picked up a milk bottle - fell over .
and broke the milk b~ milk bottle and I think I cut my knee .

lying in a pram .
looking up and smelling the plastic from my old pram <oh I see>

I also tell my kids some times I'm sure this is probably . ya' know a fictional memory .
I think I can remember breast feeding . I think I remember that . but .
I I no no that's very very young . 
<laugh> and I sometimes think was it my sister who was seven years younger .

cos I remember my sister being .
breastfed very well ya' know . ah - you want some more memories?

but we had so much fun and freedom . like it I can remember .
 and I bunch of us boys taking off . 
to the other side of Belfast . 
a~ r~ up the local mountains which be like similar to the Port Hills of Chirstchurch .
but bit bigger bit further away . and a bit more interesting . we'd take off half of the day
. a~ up . bit further again to a place called local Colinglen .
and us kids used to spend a day in the glen it was a little f~ wooded area . 
we'd be coming back at night cos you didn't eat all day 
you just left home and went . 
and on our way down the Falls road . the kids'd . were getting hungry .
you'd knock on some lady's door and say Mrs . can we have a jam piece .
nothing but a piece of bread and butter and jam . and they'd always give you it .

Interviewer 1061SCN: oh is that right

1061SCN: cos that's just what it was like in those days there were all these
well well you can imagine bunch of little kids .

this is what kids did <laugh> and ah . 
<wow> those sort of things you know like now you'd be 
terrified at your kid doing that but <yeah>
we used to stay out all night in the glen a couple of times stayed out in the . 
come back in the morning . for . families didn't worry about you . na .

1061SCN: n~ oh t~ the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
<laugh> ah th~ banana oil that's a new one
