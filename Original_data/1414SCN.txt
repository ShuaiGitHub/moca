what can I think -- 
oh we used to have an awful lot of fun . down at the beach <mm> 
in fact we used to roam Nelson on our bikes 
I don't think young people can do that these days .
we used to go up the Maitai an awful lot and 
cook sausages . over an open fire and make damper . 
<oh cool> and go swimming in the river and diving on the rocks -- 
it was a great t~ place to grow up I don't know if there was anything very funny or . but ah .

sort of late at night with my friend and being met by the warden you must be Miss Fern~ Miss Gardner
and Miss Erwin . Miss Gardner? . that was . the thing that . took us back .
we went up stairs . we were in a big dor~ almost a dormitory it used to be a ward of the maternity hospital .
and a voice from the darkness said . we had to eat . peach and lettuce with a fork for our tea .
the Home Science school were renowned for their Sunday night salads <yeah> 
what else <peaches> - oh it was very carefree days I don't I think the young people 
work harder than we do~ we did cos they don't have time for any fun today because they're always doing some assignment or 
some other fancy thing

now it's not a test of reading skill <mm> so you might like to look at it first . 
and let me know when you are ready to read it aloud <mhmm> .

1414SCN: -- 
 -- okay -
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly six~ ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short work in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer (JW): well . we have finished the recording . it went okay didn't it? 

1414SCN: yip mm

Interviewer (JW): so which test have you found the hardest? - 

1414SCN: oh redoing that fancy drawing with the funny little bits and pieces sticking on its side 

Interviewer (JW): well thank you
