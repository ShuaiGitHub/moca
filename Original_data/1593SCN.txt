yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself . in an old . black . frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard . clings to his chin . giving those who observe him . an a~ pronounced feeling . of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and . with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be . modern in his language .
