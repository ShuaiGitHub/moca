you wish to know all about my grandfather . he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black fr~ frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather like to be modern in his language .
