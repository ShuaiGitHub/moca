yet he still thinks as . swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with usually several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest . upon a small organ - except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less - but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . -
