oh about ten years ago I guess and ah 
she fell about laughing she was only four at the time she fell about laughing this this .
petite blonde beautiful child . and ah - 
I asked what the problem was and she pointed to an M G sports car you know the sort of thing a lot of people would die for - 
and I said what's wrong with it? it hasn't got a roof . 
so I guess ah a child's perception is a little different .
a lot of people would have loved to have had a . 
car like that <mm> with a blonde with her hair streaming behind you know . yeah .

Interviewer (Anne): just want you to look at that passage 
it's not a test of reading skill um . 
might want to have a look at it first or otherwise just start reading when you're ready --

1387SCN: the grandfather passage - 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard cl~ clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to wo~ walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (Anne): excellent thank you . well that's finished the recording it went okay didn't it?

1387SCN: yeah yeah fine 

Interviewer (Anne): which test was the hardest? 

1387SCN: ah . yeah -- 
remembering that drawing and ah sometimes the words but yeah . 
everything else seemed to be okay <great> yeah
