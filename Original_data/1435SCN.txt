 well he's nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet still he thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilful~ skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he usually takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we've often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
