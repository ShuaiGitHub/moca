pretty traumatic .

just let me know when you're ready to go - 

1490SCN: oh that's I can start right now <mhmm> --
the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself . in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him .
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk . 
in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to wo~ walk more .
and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (Anne): thank you . right we've finished the recording that went okay didn't it? <yes> . 
so which test was the hardest?

1490SCN: oh that ah . memory one oh the drawing .

Interviewer (Anne): the drawing from memory <yeah> yeah
