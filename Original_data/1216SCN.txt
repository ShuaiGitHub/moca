the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clin~ clings to his chin
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
