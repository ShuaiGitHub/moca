this um passage for me

1460SCN: that one there 
the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clig~ clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a profound feeling of utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a walk 
in the open air each day 
we have often h~ urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil 
grandfathers like to be modern in his language -
that is the most 

Interviewer (Amy): great we have finished the recording it went okay didn't it?

I found that quite complicated actually . <yeah>
