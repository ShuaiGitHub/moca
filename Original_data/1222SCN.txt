 he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest . upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers - 
 banana oil - g~ grandfather likes to be modern in his language
