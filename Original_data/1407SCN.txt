1407SCN: a friend and I were in Fiji and we decided to go horse riding -
we went out we rented a couple of horses from an Indian farmer .
away we went out into the bush . 
he seemed to know where he was going . and I just followed .
we got out to a nice little place . a stream running through some trees . 
and . we decided to stop and have lunch 
so being the horseman that I'm not I took the saddles off -
and let the horses go . on a long rope to have a feed -
after lunch I put the saddle back on his horse . he climbed on .
I put the saddle back on mine got one foot in .
legged over . and before I hit the saddle the horse bolted - 
I looked ahead I knew by putting my weight on the left foot I was going to the right . 
and I knew that whatever happened I was going to lose contact with that horse <mm> -
so I looked at the scrub I thought there's a lot of scratchy stuff there then in the distance I could see . 
a tree branch - and I thought . 
I've seen all those old western movies where they grab it . so I did . 
and swung in the tree . horse bolted away from m~ underneath me 
I finally caught it and I thought what is wrong here so I took the h~ the saddle back off .
shook out the sack that was underneath . put it on - 
saddle . and I thought . oh now .
what damage am I going to do to myself when I get back on - <mm> 
all was well . we got back --
um . my friend said all he could see was a pair of sunglasses swearing in the tree
 --

1407SCN: yeah okay we'll try that <yip okay> .
the grandfather passage 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
 we have often urged . him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (AH): thank you . so we've finished the recording it went okay didn't it? .

1407SCN: yeah 

Interviewer (AH): cool <yeah> um wh~ so which test was the hardest? .
