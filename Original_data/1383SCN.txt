1383SCN: do you wana include the . the heading .
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him 
a pronounced feel~ feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
