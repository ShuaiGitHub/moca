the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather . well 
he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often her~ . urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
