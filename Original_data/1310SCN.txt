Interviewer 1310SCN: now I'd like you to tell me about an early happy childhood memory . just for a few minutes . 

1310SCN: an early happy childhood memory <mm> -- 

: -- 

1310SCN: really the only early happy childhood memory that comes to mind was the fact that me and my brother - 
were very close eighteen months apart . and we used to always play together he's younger than I am -- 
ah - but we used to go to the races with my parents at Wingatui and Forbury park . 
but we'd always wind up at the ah stables - where the horses were - 
we enjoyed the animals . ah and in fact if we got a chance to walk ~ walk a . a horse around a . a sort of birdcage area . 
to cool down after a race . this was great fun <mm> ah . 
so th~ yeah that was a highlight 

Interviewer 1310SCN: lovely anything else that um you can recollect about the days there um 

1310SCN: well we spent a lot of time playing in the town belt . 
<ahuh> in Dunedin . um . that's the town belt athe north end of Highgate - 
ah by Prospect park . ah where we used to play football and cricket . ah - and collect passionfruit - 
cos there were pass~ wild passionfruit vines . which were . ah . 
growing in the town belt . and in season - it was terrific to climb these trees to a -- 
almost a frightening height now when I think about it . ah but 
being very light I was able to get right to . the extremes .
and get all these passionfruit and of course we'd eat them but ah . 
we'd always collected many more than we could consume . so we'd leave a trail of passionfruit skins up Highgate for about
the first hundred yards til we got home . 
we also used to like going along Cannington road to the Ross creek reservoir . which . had a - 
large bush area . ah there were birds . um . lot of pigeons and tuis . 
ah in fact I've been back there recently wit~ within the last four years . and ah -- 
I think there were more tuis there but there were less pigeons but they were they were um . 
yeah they were things that . I really enjoyed -

1310SCN: the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . 
 he's really nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself . in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a prof~nounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with a zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to wor~ to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer 1310SCN: that's great . oh so we've finished the recording now that went okay didn't it ?
