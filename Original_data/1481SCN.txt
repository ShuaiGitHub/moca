1481SCN: something like nine to twelve I was at boarding school . um -- 
ah I . I guess it could be funny now that um . 
four or five of us decided . a~ the school was in the middle of the country
<mhmm> and four or five or us decided to . leave .
and . go to the . little village nearby to buy some sweets . 
and ah somebody in the village obviously .
reported us and when we got back the headmistress was standing at the . 
the school gates waiting on us so ah . 
it wasn't particularly funny at the time but when you look back on it now we were kind of stupid 

Interviewer (AH): what happened as a result? 

1481SCN: oh ah . we got some detention points or. and a speaking to it wasn't anything . 
serious but um . you sort of think o~ on it now and it .

that's a story anyway -

Interviewer (AH): okay um . can you tell me a bit more about that

1481SCN: being at boarding school? 
oh it was okay . um I actually went there when I was ten . 
um . and . it wasn't that far away from my hou~ from my home I lived in Glasgow .
ah but my I'm the youngest in . my family . and um . 
I was . at that time . not . not as . 
well I didn't appear to be as bright as as the rest of my family and mum and dad thought that I would probably.
not be good staying on at the school that they'd been in .
so I was sent to a . a boarding school um . 
which there was only about a hundred and thirty .
students there so it was . um quite small classes and um 
things like that so I mean I think it had its plusses but um .
and I just accepted it it's what . you know you didn't think anything else about it . 
um but probably now it's a bit strange because a lot of . because most of my friends were from - 
we weren't all from the one city <mm> 
and so now they're all spread throughout the world and it's .
you know it's been hard to <mm> to keep in touch there's ah I'm in touch with about two or three . 
people still but that's all out of my class . 
um . you know whereas . 
Christchurch here <mm> you know people sen~ tend to sort of still know all the people they were at school with <mm> 
but ah no it was okay <cool>

and we have a house over in Akaroa and um . 
my son . and his friends go out . water skiing early in the morning and we come back .
and have . bacon and eggs and all that sort of thing and I never . 
never have that because it just doesn't .

1481SCN: I'm good yip <good> -

Interviewer (AH): okay - could you read this passage for me . 
it's not a test of reading skill <oh> so you might want to look at it first 
um just let me know when you're ready to read it out loud -- 

1481SCN: I should be okay - the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather well 
he is nearly ninety three year~ years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old bra~ black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he usu~ he slowly . takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer (AH): thank you -- 
so we've um we've finished the recording it went okay didn't it? 

1481SCN: yeah that was fine <yeah> . 

Interviewer (AH): okay so which test was the h~ did you find the hardest? . 

1481SCN: um -- probably the . the drawing . of that the big drawing and remembering the f~
five words that you . said <yip>
