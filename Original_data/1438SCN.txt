Interviewer (Amy): um so I'm just gonna get you to read this passage for me 

1438SCN: the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several butt~ buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest on a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
