it doesn't necessarily need to be funny then just . just a recollection of something from your childhood -

1379SCN: ok - - my first job . interview was very interesting . the person that was interviewing me for the job 
was a professional man . I went into the office . to be interviewed . he was sitting with his back to me . 
and at no stage during the ten minute interview did he turn round and look at me -
them one thing I remembered to this day is that he said 'your wages will be found in the third molar' . 
and for . the whole week that I was working there I worried about the third molar . 
where are my wages . until I finally realised he was talking about a book in his library 
called the third molar . and in that book was my little brown envelope of wages 
where it was every week . for the three years I worked for him . 
he was a dentist

1379SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice a day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ and with zest 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
