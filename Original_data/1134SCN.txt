1134SCN:  right I'll start now the grandfather passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice a day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language I like that
