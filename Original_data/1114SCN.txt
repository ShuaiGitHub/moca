1114SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still s~ thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with th~ several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
