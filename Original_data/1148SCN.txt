across the . paddocks at our home . and climb up on a . ah a bramble
fence a bramble hedge which was covered with . ah . a green
leafy growth which meant it would bounce . about .

1148SCN: good I'll just read it by sight . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses him himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
. giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less 
but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

um . without being aware that I was going to have to do it the second time
