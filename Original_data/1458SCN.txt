1458SCN: um well . on April the thirteenth when I was about ten I was biking down Bealey Avenue with my sister .
and I was lagging behind and she was looking around to see where I was and didn't notice a car turning right and got caught on .
the bumper bar <oh> um fortunately she wasn't too badly injured but her teeth were broken and my parents were in the .
middle of her having orthodontic treatment so I was not exactly popular 
but everytime the thirteenth of s~ 
a month comes around or Frida~ it was Friday the thirteenth actually <oh right> now I think about it 
Friday the thirteenth so everytime a Friday the thirteenth comes around I think of that particular incident
 which wasn't funny but it does certainly stick in my mind <all right> mm

Interviewer (Simon): so here is this passage for you to read 
it's not a test of reading skill so ah if you want to look through it first that's fine 
but when you're ready you can just read that aloud .

1458SCN: the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have oftend urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (Simon): excellent thank you very much .-
