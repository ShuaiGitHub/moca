<oh that's rough> I had to change schools 
I um remember being quite ah . nervous about going to a new school where I knew nobody i~ it was a very small school .
with twenty seven pupils between primer one and then standard six <oh wow> that was a change . 
and I was there for only . um half a year and then I was . at age eleven I went to boarding school in Christchurch.
which I had been looking forward to but I hated when I got there <oh right> .
coming from a farm with wide open spaces being confined with very strict rules at school was ah a real shock and I was very homesick <mm> 

Interviewer 1007SCN: I can imagine <yeah> . so what school was that?

1007SCN: so I was there for six years and that was um - 
very I was very pleased to leave when I did leave <right> I don't have happy memor~ memories of my school days <right>
because of ah . there not taking discipline well and and getting into trouble and losing outings and 
talking after lights out and all sorts of things like that <excellent>

Interviewer 1007SCN: <mm> great . all right so we're nearly finished so are you all right there you're okay ? <mm? mm> . cool .
okay so . just this last bit all I need you to do is read um this passage aloud .
now it's not a test of reading skill or anything like that so feel free to look through it and take your time 
and you just let me know when you're ready to read that out 
-- 

1007SCN: right . the grandfather passage - 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less -
he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1007SCN: excellent . thank you very much 
all right so we~ we're done there that's everything

1007SCN: that's everything <yip> oh well that's not too . onerous is it <yip>
is this an ongoing research

Interviewer 1007SCN: yeah so that went i~

1007SCN: will they um want to test me again at a later stage to see how my memory is
or are they quite what is it is it 

Interviewer 1007SCN: um w~ not definitely not in relation to what we do today <mm> 
um but basically we're screening at the moment - anywhere between four and six hundred people <mm> .
so basically y~ we're compiling a database of um as many participants as we can <mm> 
and hopefully out of all those participants we'll be able to find people for studies that are coming up <mm>

1007SCN: cos I'm always interested in . reasearch <excellent> so I'm quite prepared to .
help if it's needed 

Interviewer 1007SCN: all right cool yeah <mm> well I mean obviously it will take 
about two to three months to get everyone through and things like that actually I think I can stop that now
