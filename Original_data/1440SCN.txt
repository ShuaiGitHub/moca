we had a lot of people round the table . 
um my mother gave us very very healthy food always .
lots of f~ vegetables and fruit and -
brown bread - but I learnt that there was such a thing as white bread .
and I wanted . white bread . 
and so . one particular day when I felt . fairly stroppy . I said I wanted 
white bread . and they said no . 
and I said white bread . white bread 
and they put me out the door .
I couldn't reach the handle . because in those days a lot of h~ doors had the handles up very high .
and so I kicked the door I went into one of my incredibly famous . tantrums . 
banged and kicked and called out white bread white bread white bread . 
until finally I must have - given in . 
and - my dad came to the door and said .

Interviewer (Anne): um what do you like best for breakfast? -

Interviewer (Anne): so we're nearly finished are you okay? <yip> --
just have this passage here which I'd like you to read 
<mhmm> it's not test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first .
<okay> just let me know when you're ready to read it aloud .

: -- 

Interviewer (Anne): ready? 

1440SCN:  yes <okay> . the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather .well . 
 he's nearly ninety three years old . yet . 
 he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we've often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer (Anne): excellent thank you
