 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .  he
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
