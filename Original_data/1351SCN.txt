yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock 
coat usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon the organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil
