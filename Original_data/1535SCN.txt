turned up in Port Levy because of the fog . we went all the way .
and I was chosen because I could swim so well . 
I ah we went all the way back to Lyttleton and came back which took us about a hour and a half . 
um and on our arrival the person that we were l~ looking for had turned up .
at the wharf within five minutes . of us leaving . so

1535SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
