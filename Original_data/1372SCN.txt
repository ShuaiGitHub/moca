well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with sever~ several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we h~ often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
I don't quite know what banana oil means
