Interviewer (JW): mhmm just in your time .

1442SCN: the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (JW):  well . we have finished the recording .
it went okay didn't it?

1442SCN:  thanks I hope so 
so which test have you found the hardest? .

1442SCN: and trying to think of something to say a story when was younger from when I was younger 

Interviewer (JW): thank you very much
