piece of wood which broke and I was left hanging .

affect my the use of the hand but always

1464SCN: the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him   a
 a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
