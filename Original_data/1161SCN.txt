1161SCN:  you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in a dark black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who deserv~ who observe him . a 
 pronounced feeling of . utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully 
 and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter . when the snow or the ice prevents - 
 he slowly takes a . short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to . be modern in his language
