and on the way out it was ir~ irresistible I was just going to have a little suck and nobody would know <I can see where this is going> 
and by the time I got out I had another little one and I wandered very slowly through the garden and my~ I got to my father and I gave him the chocolate
and I still remember him coming back in and saying to my mummy and this tiny little bit of chocolate on the tip of his finger and he said

1090SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of u~ the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
