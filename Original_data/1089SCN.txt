1089SCN: one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

Interviewer 1089SCN: excellent can you now tell me about an early childhood memory - 

1089SCN: war 

Interviewer 1089SCN: war yeah . 

1089SCN: I was in London during the war <oh yeah> and I . was evacuated I th~ well in the last year <mm> -
but after the battle of Britain . <yeah> so I experienced a lot of bombing and um . gunfire <my friend>

Interviewer 1089SCN: my grandparents were um - were in London during the blitz . 

1089SCN: your grandparents ? <yeah> 

Interviewer 1089SCN: my my 

1089SCN: am I that old ? 

Interviewer 1089SCN: well um my grandfather would have been very young but my my great grandfather and his wife were there and um . my grandmother was um a Romany gypsy
<oh really> so she had to they a~ her whole family had to change their names and . and h~ hide because they were on 
Hitler's extermination list so . whenever the German planes would come over . she was very fiesty cos she was a gypsy I think .
but she would come out of her shelter and shake her fist at them and then go back in . um so she was quite funny but um . 
yeah no it sounded - we used to hear the stories and it was pretty pretty atrocious .so how how old would you have been ?

1089SCN: I was seven when the war finished 

Interviewer 1089SCN: seven when the war finished 

1089SCN: it w~ wasn't atrocious for me ah . it was atrocious i~ in retrospect but at the time that's a~ the only life you know <yeah yeah that's true> 
and so you don't compare it with a better life <exactly> - however I I suffered very badly from bronchitis and um 
various other things because . often we'd be sitting in the cold celler <yeah> as a as a sh~ ah air raid shelter . 
people would be smoking <ah yip> it was damp . cold . terrible conditions really <mm> or in an underground station <mm> -- yeah . 
so it wasn't it wasn't the best and I think that's partly why . one of the reasons I'm deaf <oh okay yeah> because of ah . 
um bomb blasts and um - inf~ infections <okay yip> 

Interviewer 1089SCN: my um my grandfather's sister sort of my great aunt I guess she she died of tuberculosis during the . during the war . um. for the same reason I think .
um that she couldn't get . medical attention very quickly <mm yeah> um and she was in a cellar and it was cold and damp and . 
all those sort of things so . yeah I I can imagine that the whole process of that . 
and just the . even though it's what you knew you know the anxiety of that must have had some sort of effect . um . 

1089SCN: but I used to get um . <yeah> very bad tonsilitis <yeah> my tonsils would would um grow to such an extent that I couldn't swallow and I couldn't um 
I could hardly breathe . <oh> sometimes <yeah> . so ah it w~ it was um a bit traumatic 

Interviewer 1089SCN: yeah it would have been . yeah . so can you tell me a little bit about your family - - mother father ? 

1089SCN: my father <children> was a sub mariner . 

Interviewer 1089SCN: a what ? 

1089SCN: a sub mariner <oh okay yip> h~ he was a sailor who went on submarines <yeah> . and . I didn't see very much of him . because of the war <yip> . um - - 
I have a half brother - my parents . were divorced . <okay> after the war <yip> . and ah . my father remarried and I have a half brother Peter .
ah I no longer have contact with . um . any of my family <oh okay> . I've been back but they've all vanished <oh really> 
I think they moved onto a better life though they probably . found nicer houses to live in and . and so on <oh okay yip> 
but I lost touch when I went to Canada <oh yip> - um . my family . 

Interviewer 1089SCN: what about your children 

1089SCN: ah - I have two daughters . um - who are completely opposite one of them is um . 
very serious and . the other one is completely frivolous . one of them . the serious one . 
is v~ very successful <yeah> in whatever she does <yeah> . and . the frivolous one is . she's successful in her own way - but um - 
she's very impetuous <oh yes> . my . eldest daughter the one who is very successful . i~ is very much like me <yeah> . and . 
my youngest daughter is very much like - um - <your wife?> their mother <ah yip> no~ not my present wife <ah yip>
th~ that wife um died mm . three or four years ago <oh> -
but it was actually ah a blessing for her because she had had a very bad stroke <oh yip> -- and her life wasn't very good <mm> - - 

Interviewer 1089SCN: yip - I have um three sisters . so we're a family of all girls . and we're all completely different and I'm just like my father .
and um . my other sister's just like my mother . um and then the one in the middle's kind of . 
not like either 

1089SCN: like milkman perhaps 

Interviewer 1089SCN: what's that ? 

1089SCN: like the milkman 

Interviewer 1089SCN:  yeah . we kind of think that but then my sister um who isn't like . in personality isn't like um . my parents . she looks exactly like my father .
exact same eyes exact same chin exact same nose and . sh~ so she she's definitely his but um . she's very . impetuous and - 

1089SCN: do you get on ? 

Interviewer 1089SCN: yeah well sometimes she's um . she's very . she's quite bitter . about lots of things that happened when we were young . 
and um so 

1089SCN: tow~ towards 
you 

Interviewer 1089SCN: no no towards my mum <oh really> towards my parents . 
um so she's all very 

1089SCN: chil~ children are dreadful 

Interviewer 1089SCN: I know and um 

1089SCN: like that 

Interviewer 1089SCN: and . cos I used to I think when I was a teenager used to well cos when you're a teenager everybody . has something wr~ 
some beef with their parents but um . 
yeah she she's I grew u~ grew out of that . you know I grew up and realised that . you know your parents are are people too 
so they're allowed to . yeah exactly and I think um as children

1089SCN: mm and they have failings they're allowed to fail

Interviewer 1089SCN: your parents are like . they know everything and they . 
they're you know gods in your eyes and then it's 
you need to you know grow up and realise that they're just people and they are allowed to make mistakes but I don't think she's grown up 
um she's older cos I'm the I'm the youngest but she's she's . she is grown up but she hasn't grown up in that respect . 
<mm> and I don't know if it's um . it may not be something she'll learn until she has her own children . and then she'll realise that she has .
failings as well . um that she her p~ her children are going o get grumpy at her for .
um but yeah so we sometimes yeah don't get along cos she's quite mean to my mum . 

1089SCN: yeah my older daughter's - I've actually she's a perfectionist and <yeah> she doesn't like failure <yeah> and she doesn't like failure in other people 

Interviewer 1089SCN: cos I'm a perfectionist but I only . I'm my worst critic so . I'll only l~ everybody else I'll see as being . 
much . you know up here and only me a whole foot doen <yeah> which is 
good and bad so I'm my own worst critic but um yeah some people who . 
can be very perfectionist like . don't like failure in other people as well and that's when it gets . to be . hard <mm> .
um . cos everybody has failings <that's right that's right> yeah . 

1089SCN: you hope what you try and do is minimise them 

Interviewer 1089SCN: yes exactly you try and do your best with what you have I think . anyway I digress
so what did you have for breakfast ? - - 

1089SCN: ah porridge made of oat bran and sultanas . and a cup of tea before that <yip> and um . 
toast and homemade marmalade <mm> homemade toast as a matter of fact <oo> 

Interviewer 1089SCN: what sort of toast 

1089SCN: oh um . wholemeal with ah s~ some oat bran in it . <yum> I m~ I make it br~ well we have a bread machine and ah <yeah> . 

Interviewer 1089SCN: I love fresh bread there's nothing nothing quite the same . as freshly baked bread <and um> 

1089SCN: ah real coffee - <oh yip> 

Interviewer 1089SCN: I wish I could drink coffee . I love the smell of it but I can't drink it . it um . raises my heart rate too much 

1089SCN: really

Interviewer 1089SCN: yeah and I get really dizzy and - um . fainty 
which is a shame because I love I love the smell of coffee and I would love to be a coffee person I'm really . envious of people that .
you know they go out for coffee and they sit there with their . 
really niice cup of coffee and they love it <yeah> and they . love everything about it and I . 
sit there with my . hot chocolate which is still good but . 

1089SCN: c~ c~ coffee has replaced the cigarette I think . <what's that?> coffee has replaced the cigarette .

Interviewer 1089SCN: it has yeah cigarettes are not that . popular anymore really . I don't have um . 

1089SCN: but people people used to - h~ have a break <mm> and a cigarette was symbolic of it <yeah> and now of course the~ the coffee is <it's coffee yeah> 

Interviewer 1089SCN: my my entire family smokes I'm the only non-smoker but I don't have any friends that smoke so . 
my whole generation I don't know . anyone that smokes .

1089SCN: I'm s~ s~ surprised when I see people smoking 

Interviewer 1089SCN: yeah same same it's like . strange behaviour . okay . um so . 
we've gotten off topic what do you like best for breakfast is what you described what you like best ? - -

1089SCN: well I particularly like this batch of marmalade <yes> because it tastes very orangey <oh good> um i~ i~ i~ it it's different every time <yip>

Interviewer 1089SCN: I love marmalade . 

1089SCN: or . what can I go without ? --
yeah I think I think the toast and marmalade <yip okay> - 

Interviewer 1089SCN: okay so we're nearly finished are you okay <yeah> yip great 
so the last thing we have to do is is I'd like you to read this passage um it's not a test of reading skill so feel free to um 
have a read over it and get familiar with it before you start . and whenever you are ready just start reading it out loud and you'll be recorded

1089SCN: it's working now ? <yip> - the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer 1089SCN: okay so we're done that went okay didn't it ? <yip> excellent - - 

1089SCN: that r~ wasn't really my speaking voice . that was my reading out loud voice <oh that's okay> is that all right <yeah no that's fine> okay
because I've been on the stage <oh okay> and I and I and I know that I speak differently . 

Interviewer 1089SCN: that's fine because um 

1089SCN: that's another hobby that I've given up <oh okay>

Interviewer 1089SCN: oh right well that's really amazing I um cos there's different parts of this so there's a bit where you read a formal . 
passage um and I d~ I don't know anything about the study that they're doing but um 
there's bits where they get you to talk . spontaneously like you were before telling us um . about - 
your <war mm> early childhood memories and then there's a bit where you actually read a a certain statement so I'm sure they . 
have some analysis

1089SCN: they'll work it out 

Interviewer 1089SCN: that they . take into account I'm not sure how it works I'll have to ask them - 
yeah um so which test was the hardest ? -

1089SCN: oh ah redrawing that complic~ complicated figure 

Interviewer 1089SCN: most people say that
