1152SCN: fine 

Interviewer 1152SCN: brilliant . so I would like you to please read this passage - it's not a test of reading skills <1152: oh right> so
but ah feel free to have a nice good read of it and whenever you're ready just start reading but take your time - -

1152SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully w~ and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk into the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - -

Interviewer 1152SCN: brilliant . so we're done .

1152SCN: we're done 

Interviewer 1152SCN: it went ok didn't it 

1152SCN: it wasn't too stressful oh yeah wasn't as bad <I: not too bad is it> as a job interview and I was thinking I thought
do you need to switch that off <I: oh no that's fine> or am I still being recorded <I: oh yeah> .
um w~ there was a job ioterview that I had for my current job and we had to do things which .
are quite relevent to the job <I: yeah> but at the time you know a job en~ interview is stressful anyway <I: yes>
and having to do um . all the c~ the computer work which was involved when I just got myself into a total . 
pickle <I: state> yes <I: laugh> that but fortunately I . 
got the job <I: got the job laugh> so I obviously redeemed myself so yes yes 

Interviewer 1152SCN: yeah it's always um people come in here and . you say to them some will be easy and some will be harder and 
<1152: mmm> they just I think in their head they just imagine <1152: yes> all the harder the harder bits 
that they could possibly get to do <1152: yes> and 

1152SCN: <I: so> and I can still remember church . ruby red daisy but I can't remember the other one 

Interviewer 1152SCN: yes very good 

1152SCN:  re~ b~ I will I've been 

Interviewer 1152SCN: very good you'll remember those for years to come

1152SCN: remembering them every time we had a little gap 

Interviewer 1152SCN: yeah

1152SCN: what was the f~ what was the one forgot 

Interviewer 1152SCN: face 

1152SCN: face 

Interviewer 1152SCN: which is actually the one that most people forget I think it's because it's the first one 

1152SCN: and it's not really <I: it's> related to the other ones <I: yeah>

Interviewer 1152SCN: and then the other ones you can kind of you can put a bit of a story together <1152: mmm> with the other ones 
you know the vel~ velvet . seats in the church and the . 

1152SCN: oh I didn't get to that stage but yes yes

Interviewer 1152SCN: daisys growing outside and 
yeah <b: but it's funny> red velvet 

bystander: because . people often say face in the F recall 

Interviewer 1152SCN: yes they

bystander: <I: do> but still forget <1152: mmm> to say it - then so <I: yeah> <1152: mmm> some subconscious must remember it 

1152SCN: do you always use the same l~ letter yes <b: mmm>

Interviewer 1152SCN: yeah . yeah I think um we use that one because you can um very easily mistake if for P H 

1152SCN: oh I see like <I: um> so you wouldn't accept psychologist <I: yeah exactly> or physiotherapist or <I: yeah> 

Interviewer 1152SCN: <1152: right> so lots of people will say things <1152: oh> with the P H sound 
but yeah and so I think it's also in that it's one of those ones that .
I think there are some letters that are easier than others too 

1152SCN: well yes there are because some letter you know even with um . scrabble <I: mmm> and things like that 
some letters have higher value <I: yeah> because they're used less often so I mean if you gave them a X or a Z or a

Interviewer 1152SCN: yeah that would be 

1152SCN: that would be seriously <I: very>

Interviewer 1152SCN: hard <1152: yeah challenging> yep and I think also there's quite a few um proper nouns you can think of with 

1152SCN: yes

Interviewer 1152SCN: the F
France and Finland and . <1152: mmm that's true> all those sorts of ones as well 

1152SCN: I was trying to think of more flowers but . I couldn't think of .

Interviewer 1152SCN: mmm <1152: mmm> there's lots of <1152: a lot> 
it's funny how many people say friend immediately followed by foe as 

1152SCN: oh ok I didn't get either of those yes

Interviewer 1152SCN: well yeah friend foe
um and - what's the other one I'm thinking of . can't remember . anyway . so which test was the hardest -

1152SCN: oh . oh re drawing that - yes 

Interviewer 1152SCN: yep no that's mostly what <1152: yes> everyone will say re drawing that horrible drawing 
<1152: yes> and you didn't tell me I had to remember it <1152: no> . I say oh sorry ok I'll s~ stop
