1405SCN: the grandfather passage -
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his si~ chin .
giving those who d~ observe him a p~ profound feeling of the utmost respect -
twice a da~ twice each day he plays skilfully with zest .
upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less -
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
