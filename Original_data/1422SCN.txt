you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
so he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
no yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest .
upon a small organ .
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
