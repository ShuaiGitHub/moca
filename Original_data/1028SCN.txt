I'll get you to read this passage now it's not a test of reading skill .
<no> so you're allowed to . 
familiarise yourself with it and . <mm> and have a good read of it and whenever you're ready just just start reading aloud

1028SCN: oh well just start now . um the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
