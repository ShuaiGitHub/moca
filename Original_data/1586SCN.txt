 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
 twice  twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . 
 banana oil . father grandfather likes to be modern in his language 
 I don't know what banana oil is
