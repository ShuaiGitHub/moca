1021SCN: the grandfather . passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observed him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often . urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
