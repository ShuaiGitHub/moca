1136SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in a lo~ old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
