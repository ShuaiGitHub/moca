a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the . utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a walk . a s~ a short walk in the open air each day . we have often . ur~ urged him to walk more and smoke less .
