 the grandfather passage . 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard . 
 clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
 . twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
