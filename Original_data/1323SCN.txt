usually with several buttons missing . a long bla~ a a sorry a long beard clear clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ except .
in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
