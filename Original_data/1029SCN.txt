1029SCN: I remember my father and I used to . 
race along the path there was a long from a . four year old three year old's point of view a long path out to the street
and one day he won I always bet him but one day he won 
<do you do you> it's a very vivid memory . <yeah> and I remember being so surprised

Interviewer 1029SCN: or do you think you were very fast

1029SCN: except on this surprising occasion -

Interviewer 1029SCN:  I used to do that with my dad as well we'd race on the beach . 
could you tell me a little bit about your family as well . 

1029SCN: oh I had the w~ mother and father . ah two grandmothers one grandfather . my father's father died before I was born .
and I had one older brother <mhmm> . 
I've never been marrried my brother has two sons they all live in Canada . 
the sons come out and visit . well so does my brother my sister in law has Alzheimers disease <oh> or a related disorder <mhmm> .
so w~ she had distinct symptoms when she was sixty . so my brother hasn't been out for some years which is a shame . and ah - 
my mother had Alzheimers disease . which means that my nephews have got it on both sides of the family <oh> 

Interviewer 1029SCN: well I've um . I~ cos I I research Alzheimers disease that's my 

1029SCN: my mother's sister had .

 so that was sad both si~ both of them .
there was no . nothing obvious about their appearance but . 
who knew to notice ? <yeah> my father reckoned they were both on the ball when they died but <yip> 

Interviewer 1029SCN: well I think only ten percent is hereditary . <mm> so the the rest of it is just .
s~ called spontaneous Alzheimers so . anyone can get it and it's generally associated with age and they're trying to figure out <mm> .
what else is causing it . to see how people can . prevent it or treat it and things like that .
so that's that's part of what I do is try to look at at different . different <oh> reasons for the cause of Alzheimer's disease

1029SCN: mm 

Interviewer 1029SCN: okay okay - so . last thing - um could you read this passage please . 
it's not a test of reading skill so you're welcome to have a read through it and familiarise yourself with it before you start
and whenever you are ready you can just begin 

1029SCN: where on earth did this come from? 

Interviewer 1029SCN: I know it's completely . crazy little passage I think it's got lots of different words in it that are . 

1029SCN: oh is that what it is 

Interviewer 1029SCN: they want to see how 
peo~ different people pronounce it or . something like that 

1029SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we often urge him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language oh 

Interviewer 1029SCN:  great . so we're done it went okay didn't it <yeah> .

1029SCN: <excellent> just your drawings

1029SCN: oh trying to think of words with F <oh okay> 

Interviewer 1029SCN: yeah no a~ as soon as someone says . 

1029SCN: I think that F's . I think F's a difficult word any~ l~

Interviewer 1029SCN: do it quickly as quick as you can and you 
it is and I~ that's probably why 

1029SCN: the code cracker today was some thing . double F .
