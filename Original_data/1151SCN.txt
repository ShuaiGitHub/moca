1151SCN: the grandfather passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observed him . 
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
