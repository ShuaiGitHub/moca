the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather well .
he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in old black . frock . coat . or an old . black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced 
feeling . of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest aspon~ u~ upon a small organ .
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents -
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
 but I don't I don't get that but
