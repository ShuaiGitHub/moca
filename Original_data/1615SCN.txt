1615SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the w~ snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air every day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 
golly sounds like my grandmother except for the beard
