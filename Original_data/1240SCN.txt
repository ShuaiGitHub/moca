Interviewer 1240SCN: now I've got this passage here that I'd like you to read . it's not a test of reading skill but
um have a wee look at it and then tell me when you're ready to read it out loud thank you 

1240SCN:  right ok the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully . and with z~ zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer 1240SCN: which test was the hardest? -

1240SCN: oh that . copying that - um figure . that <that> . thing it was hopeless I'm not very good at doing that sort of thing
