1013SCN: the grandfather passage -
 you wish to know all about my grandfather - 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet still he thinks as swiftly as ever - 
 he dresses himself in an old . black frock coat - usually with several buttons missing -- 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe . him a pronounced feeling . of the utmost respect -- 
 twice a day he plays . skilfully . and with zest a small organ -- 
 except in the winter when . the snow or ice prevents -- he slowly takes a short walk into the open air each day -- 
 we often urge him to walk more . and smoke less - but he always answers - banana oil -- 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language --
