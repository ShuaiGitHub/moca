road where the bus came along . and it was a fairly narrow road .

so if I rode in the middle of the road the bus had to go behind me .

the bus came once and hour from Plymouth .

<great> the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather? .
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air every day . 
we have often urged him to wa~ walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language  to
