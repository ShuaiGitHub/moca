Interviewer 1130SCN: now tell me about an early happy childhood memory - 

1130SCN: I've got lots of happy um childhhod memories and if you put it down to going to school I loved going to school 
I could have gone for ever <yip> how's that . so is that all you want 

Interviewer 1130SCN: um what is it that you . um loved about school <the~> 

1130SCN: oh I just I just liked being there I liked being with other kids I liked learning and such like and it was a pleasure to go to school - 

Interviewer 1130SCN: do you have any um nice story of any occasion . 

1130SCN: oh I got into rep teams and such like and went um to Timaru from Ashburton um playing netball and such like . and . 
girls at that stage were supposed to 
in the lunch hours sit around with their gym frock over their knees you know being ladies but that did not appeal to me and luckily 
I had some friends similarly <mm>
who w~ want to play tennis and such like in the breaks not sit around . drive me bats <mm> so it was a pleasure to go to school <mm> 

Interviewer 1130SCN: was it a~ so you went in Ashburton <yes> yip <yeah I did> -- 

1130SCN: and I'll tell you something <yip> our third form class of nineteen fifty . 
one of the boys and one of the girls um got together and said fifty years on 
let us get together . and it was one of the ha~ very happy memories of going . and do you know 
we've now met two or three times just that third form class because we weren't all together in the fourth form or the fifth form some of us were 
um . but . it is an absolute pleasure to meet up with them again and my husband sa~ he's Alan 
he says you must have been a very happy class <mm> and we were <oh that's lovely> and you can 
youk now normally if you'd go to say big cocktail parties in the earlier days
you never went waltzing up to men and said how are you <mm> but the boys at school 
they're entirely different you can waltz up to them and say what have you done in the interim period <mm> and
it's it's fun so . that has been a very happy memory 

Interviewer 1130SCN: so you've kept in contact with them all over the years 

1130SCN: no hadn't kept in contact at all um 
from say about sixteen over the fifty years <really> and so when it was the afternoon tea that was the first get together 
and there was a hall first and the supper room afterwards you knew that everybody walking down that path was in your class 
fifty years on I hadn't seen some of them <no> and so you looked and said 
now who could that be 

Interviewer 1130SCN: so was it hard to recognise some of them

1130SCN: no because I'm good at it <m> and I think probably because Alan was in the bank . and we moved around
you had people whom you knew quite well all over the place and so you looked and you said well
you know could that be such and such and there was only one of the fellows that I . he had been quite a round fellow
when we were at school but he had grown ah quite tall and slim like myself um and I just didn't pick that he would be 
that but the rest you know some of the girls were round with grey hair <mm> and such like but 
but um no on the whole it wasn't difficult . but it was it was a wonderful . afternoon .

Interviewer 1130SCN: and were they all how you remember them . in terms of . personality --

1130SCN: um some have got um health problems <mm> and that has . changed . them and over the years there's been s~ quite sadness um for some of them 
and others there's been sadness and they've . coped . particularly well you know losing say two children at 
in their late teens you know motorbike accidents and things like that <mm> 
coped remarkably well <mm> yes --

Interviewer 1130SCN: um oh well thank you . what did you have for breakfast 

1130SCN: what did I have for breakfast I had two weetbix half a banana - probably two or three tab~ ah dessert spoons of yoghurt . milk .
two pieces of toast and a cup of tea - 

Interviewer 1130SCN: what do you like best for breakfast ? 

1130SCN: I like breakfast . I probably have that but at the weekends it's bacon and eggs as well bacon and egg . 
and eggs . I like breakfast <mm> .

1130SCN: yes I'm fine thank you 

Interviewer 1130SCN: all right now -- could you read . this passage please it's 
not a test of reading skill so you might like to look over it first just read it aloud when you're . ready . 

: -- 

1130SCN:  well there we are the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever pardon me 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . it's very good isn't it <it is> 

Interviewer 1130SCN: <mm> right um we're done <we're done> it went okay didn't it 

1130SCN: I have no problem with it Matthew um 
and if you were going to interview me the next time I would be happy about that <oh right> I'm happy in your company <oh> 
so there we are <lovely to hear> 

Interviewer 1130SCN: so which test was the hardest 

1130SCN: well . um . because I had to do um that sort of technical drawing thing a second time 
um I didn't remember um all of those things and I should have . 
concentrated 

Interviewer 1130SCN: no y~ you're not expected to 

1130SCN: oh yes but . i~ i~ this um . put it put it like this . I want to do it . you know in this life . if 
and a~ my attitude is you are old if you don't want to learn anything . and I don't want to be old 
how's that <no> it's got nothing to recommend it <that's good> has it ?
