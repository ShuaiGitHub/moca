Interviewer (JW): amongst friends 

1483SCN: yeah . I'll tell you about a bit of trouble I got into once if you like <yip> it was .
I suppose I was about seven and there was a a . group of us at school . and um 
one guy decided that we would . 
get some firewood for for local people you see so his his father had a small plantation .
and ah so we were going to . 
drop this tree and cut it up and give everybody some firework and you know we were sort full of good works and . and stuff . 
anyway the plan we hatched was that were going to blow this tree up 
and and we figured if we got some torch batteries and set fire to them they would blow up you see so .
one Saturday afternoon we all . gathered round this tree and 
had these batteries and . <mm> lit a little fire . 
we were standing there waiting the explosion and . 
next minute this . guy's father comes charging through the trees you know <yip> . 
and he was just beside himself <yip> we were setting fire to his forest <oh no yip yip> 
yeah . so um . yeah . 
what the hell are you kids doing here and . you know so .
we all scarpered and got on our bikes and tore home and <mm> 
hoped our parents would never find out about it but . next day they did you know . 
all hell broke loose . I don't think my mother spoke to me for a week after that <oh no> 

Interviewer (JW): well thank you for that <mm> oh excuse me - what did you have for breakfast?

1483SCN: this morning? <mhmm> we~ ah fruit and muesli and cornflakes . and toast with honey <mm nice>

I've got a kidney stone mm <oh sorry> 
I have to drink water 

Interviewer (JW): what do you like best for breakfast? .

1483SCN: yes yeah good 

Interviewer (JW): oh could you read this passage please . now this is not a test of reading skill <mhmm> 
so you might like to look at it first 
and let me know when you are ready to read it . aloud --

1483SCN: the grandfather passage - 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter .
when the snow or ice prevents he takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (JW): thank you very much . well we have finished the recording -
it went okay didn't it <mm yes> . so which test have you found the hardest? -- 

1483SCN: um -- 
the ah . the drawing one - 
I knew I didn't have it the way it was before but I couldn't sort of 
figure out just what it was although I knew it was relatively minor I had the basic - <mm>
shape yeah . yeah that was okay um -- 
yeah . and remembering those five words yeah . 

Interviewer (JW): oh you did pretty well on that too well thank you
