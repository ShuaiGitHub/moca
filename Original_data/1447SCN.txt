and my friend and I across the road 
he turned up one day and we filled his truck cab up with gorse 
he actually came back while we were in the middle of this and chased us um
we ran into my friend's house and hid in the bedroom .
and ah the next thing the Chinaman is at the door waving his ah knife .

1447SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old -
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ.
except in winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
<kay> sounds a bit familiar
