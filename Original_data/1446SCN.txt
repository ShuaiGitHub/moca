1446SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wis~ wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself . in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him .
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . that's quite comical isn't it oh dear

Interviewer (Amy): okay we have finished with the recording it went okay didn't it ?

spoken about something else and my attention's away from that .
then I simply can't recall . mm
