 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several bus~ buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow . or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - that's the wrong one 
we of~ we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he also~ always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
