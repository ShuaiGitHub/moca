he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing -- 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those 
who observe him - a pronounced feeling of upmos~ utmost respect - 
twice a day he plays skilfully . with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents .
he still takes a short walk . in the open air each day -
you have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
but he always answers - banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his . language
