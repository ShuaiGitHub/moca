1474SCN: um -- um one of the interesting experiences at one point I was 
um involved with greyhounds <mhmm> and um . greyhounds ah
the people that are involved in greyhounds are quite strange ah -- 
ah types and um . at that point in time um . 
they were all very interested to find out what made .
some people's dogs win when other people's dogs ah their own 
ah weren't achieving they found that . ah one of the leading .
ah racing people ah was feeding cabbage . as part of the dogs' diets .
so um this was when I was in Dunedin and 
the race meeting ah was to be held in Invercargill which meant leaving at four o'clock in the morning 
<mhmm> so we had the station wagon with all four guys and four dogs . 
on mattresses in the back of this very large station wagon . 
and ah they left um they left um ah the um 
um South Dunedin . got as far as ah lookout point which is perhaps maybe um -- 
four five Ks <mhmm> and the first dog broke wind um . 
this meant that the window had to be wound down and this was the middle of winter 
um at ah four o'clock in the morning as I say . 
and ah it was bitterly cold absolutely bitterly cold . 
by the time that they'd got down to um ah the turn off at Mosgiel .
which is perhaps another five Ks ah all the dogs were . breaking wind . 
so they wound all four windows down they got down as far as ah Allenton which is perhaps another ten Ks 
and ah they all had to get out of the car and started waving the doors backwards and forwards and this . 
process went on all the way to Invercargill . 
ah they arrived ah at the race meeting um at about eight o'clock and um . 
which is nearly an hour longer than it would normally have taken . 
and ah they were all feeling fairly green . the dogs 
subsequently raced and all of them came last

1474SCN: the grandfather passage -
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (SL): thank you - ah so we've finished the recording . ah it went well didn't it? .

ah which test did you find the hardest? . 
oh me~ memorising the diagram <mhmm>

Interviewer (SL): yip the complex figure?
