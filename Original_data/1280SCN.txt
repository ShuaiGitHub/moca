1280SCN: the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a profound feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
my children are always telling me to walk more - 
and the more they say it the less I'm inclined to do it 

Interviewer 1280SCN: oh so we've finished the recording there <yeah> it went ok didn't
