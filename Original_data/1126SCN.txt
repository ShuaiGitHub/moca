 you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long black beard clings to his chin giving him those . who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the wintertime when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language.
