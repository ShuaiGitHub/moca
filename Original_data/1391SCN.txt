1391SCN: --  
that's a good thing for grandfathers to do -- 
okay - <yip>
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well . he's nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest . 
 upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers - banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language -- 
banana oil? 

Interviewer (AH): I don't get it . okay thank you 

1391SCN: right who composed that? .
