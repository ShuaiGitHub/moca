1560SCN: yeah when ever you like want to go 
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he's nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer 1560SCN:  . thank you 

1560SCN: well if he's still smoking at ninety three . why bother
