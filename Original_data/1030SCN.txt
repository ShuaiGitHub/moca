Interviewer 1030SCN: now tell me about an early childhood memory --

1030SCN: my first early childhood memory was standing outside the . back gate of our . residence at -
one eight two Edgeware road St Albans - 
I was with my friends . standing underneath the blue diamond . plum tree and I proudly proclaimed to my friends today I am four years old --

Interviewer 1030SCN:  and do you remember any other things . from . back then ? - 

1030SCN: well that's a highlight because it's a birthday and . was of course im~ impale~ impressed upon my mind - fairly heavily - 
I can almost name the people who were there but ah -- passage of time of course deletes . some of their faces from my memory - um - 
we lived in the house on Edgeware road . until . my marriage which was in . nineteen . fifty . two . 
and my wife and I then moved to a house in . Cygnet street north beach which we purchased . for the princely sum of one thousand two hundred dollars --
after living there . until the birth of our children . we then moved to a house in . Palmers road . which . we had built for us by . 
a cousin who was a builder . and designed by another cousin who was an architect working for - um - who was he working for at that time --
there again that's another thing that's gone from my memory . 

Interviewer 1030SCN: okay thank you -
what did you have for breakfast ? 

1030SCN: what did I have for breakfast I had . cornies - canned . peaches and a slice of toast -

Interviewer 1030SCN: okay . what do you like to have for breakfast? 

1030SCN: that's my standard breakfast

Interviewer 1030SCN: that's your standard breakfast . okay we are nearly finished . are you okay?

1030SCN: yip .

Interviewer 1030SCN: okay -- could you please read this passage . 
it's not a test of reading skill so . you might h~ like to have a look at it first . let me know ehen you are rea~ ready to read it aloud --

1030SCN: well I think I can . read it without sort of . predigesting the banana that I got -- okay? <yip> 
 the grandfather passage - you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him . pronounced feeling of the utmost resp~ respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer 1030SCN: thank you - 
right we're done did that~ it went okay?

1030SCN: yes yeah yeah <okay> 

Interviewer 1030SCN: so which test was the hardest? -

1030SCN: um the hardest one was trying to remember the convoluted figure --

Interviewer 1030SCN: okay . thanks a lot we're finished <well> okay . um . we'll .
be in touch it may be . two to three months before we kinda get through <whatever whatever yeah> yip . 

1030SCN: <okay now> an interesting thing about walking in here today is the van der Veer <yip>
Cass van der Veer was the . partner of - my childhood . well until we were married . not him and I - um . Ron Ball - <oh okay>
Ron and . do you know the history of them at all? <no no> 
Ron and Cass of course were . partners . lived together at number fifty four Fendalton road a big pink place <yip> .
and they were renowned for what they were - um Ron -- um - Ron and I were good friends until he went to work .
for the national insurance company and I started . in the office at . for Wood brothers the flour millers -
and we used to meet together at lunch time and . go roller skating in the old radi~ outfit there <oh yip> 
and then Ron . became embroiled with . David Sinclair dot who was a . south African who came to work at the national office but -
I didn't realise until about that time that he was . um . of a different persuausion sexually to . what I was <oh okay> . um - he - 
did a lot of damage to people in his earlier years . and later on - he . 
we had a big snowstorm in August nineteen forty five I was in the airforce at that time and . so was Ron .
and we were released from . airforce duties to go where we were . fe~ felt to be most helpful in the community . Ron went to . 
work with my uncle and aunt in Springston <oh right> . because he had been to Lincoln college <oh okay> and had achieved some d~ some knowledge of .
agriculture and so on . and ah -- he went to help . 
get the stock out of the snow and so on and so forth and then he stayed with them and they looked upon him more or less as a . 
son not just a an employee and he managed the farm for them for many years . and then when he um - when they died --
he argued with the beneficiaries of the estate and got sufficient money to start in the resthome business .
<oh right> instead of farming sheep he started farming people . and of course that's where he and . Cass van der Veer <oh I see> came together <oh okay>

Interviewer 1030SCN: I~I've forgotten to get you to I need to get you to to date that . 

1030SCN: it'll still be the same day I suppose won't it <it'll still yeah> 

Interviewer 1030SCN: I'm not quite sure . why maybe I shouldn't have put the date on
