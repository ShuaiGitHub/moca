the grandfather passage 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swis~ swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buss~ buttons missing -
a long white beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pro~ profound feeling of 
the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in in in h~ his language .

words and the numbers and that kind of stuff ah
um and - trying to find ah something funny that happened 
<okay> I mean I always thought I had a good sense of humour but maybe I'm the only one
