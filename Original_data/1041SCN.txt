about eleven o clock at night we were all supposed to go to bed and we used to travel along . walk along the river bank exploring and we came to a -

1041SCN: so -
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language beautiful

Interviewer 1041SCN: thank you very much . all right so we're done now . ah that went okay didn't it .
