yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully w~ and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
