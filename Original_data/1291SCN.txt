1291SCN: the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his skin chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk . more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1291SCN: thank you - alright so we're finished all of that . finished the recording that went ok didn't it?

1291SCN: good yes I probably have him committed now talking about banana oil

1291SCN: um - well I don't know I had to really concentrate for the memory I spose .
bit of a flippity jippet brain um . and drawing I've I'm not a very good drawer 
and it's a bit of a challenge for me .

Interviewer 1291SCN: I thought you did very well in the drawing
