Interviewer 1131SCN: cool . now can you tell me about an early happy childhood memory - -

1131SCN: yes - when my grandmother died her her husband my grandfather they had a farm - - 
that left him on the farm . with nobody to run the house or anything and so . my parents and the four of us children .
went off and we went and lived on the farm . and this was at a place called Lagmhor -
and you'll all know where Lagmhor is <of course> if you went over the 
the bridge at Ashburton to Tinwald and turned right and went up the road about seven or eight miles you'd come to Lagmhor .
and so we four children there was my brother my sister me and my younger sister . we went to the Lagmhor school .
and I did very well at that school . I topped my class in every subject - 
I was the only one in it mind you it was a one teacher school during the war years 
with a young girl of about nineteen straight out of training college . to look after this . one teacher school .
with <wow> with about . sixteen ch~ pupils - well.
this particular day and o~ if it was blowing very hard we had about four or five miles to go . 
and if it was blowing very hard we wouldn't bike we would get Violet the drafthorse
and she just had a bit of rope round her neck . we'd all get on here elder brother sister 
then my younger sister and me on the bareback of Violet and trot down the road to school slide off when we got there she'd much round in the
playground during the day and we'd climb on and go home at night . 
so that was one of those things and the other thing that I can remember . <yeah> . this teacher -
it was just a one class room . with big windows that were on bars that you pulled a lever and they all opened or closed and there was only one door -
but she boarded with the . chairman of the school committee who had a farm just over the road well this particular day .
she annoyed this young boy who was a couple of years older than me - 
so when he went out out that night after school . he locked the door and took the key home and hid it in the woolshed .
well the teacher didn't turn up for tea . so the head mas~ the th~ ch~ the chairman . 
came over the next morning oh well he came looking for her and found her and he got her out .
so the next morning he turned up at school when everybody was there .
and he asked " who locked miss so and so in the school last night ? " well of course none of us knew - 
so he got us all to stand in a line - put your hand out 
he took the belt off his trousers and down the line he went and strapped every hand out the little wee kids up to the big ones and down he went again .
put his belt on and justice was done -
<excellent> and that's as true as I'm sitting here 

Interviewer 1131SCN: oh dear it's changed a wee bit in the years hasn't it <now>

1131SCN: years and years later I was ah working in Wellington and my mate there was getting married- 
and so Pat and I went to this wedding - and ah - 
we stood up to come out from the church service and there was a chap behind me much older than me and I looked at him . 
good gracious what are you doing here . to this fellow. and he said oh well 
the bridegroom's mother is my sister and this was the fellow who was the chairman of the school committee . yes

Interviewer 1131SCN: oh dear small world - cool well thank you . all right . next question . what did you have for breakfast this morning ? -- 

1131SCN: main meal of the day breakfast . 
I had three weetbix . half a banana . yoghurt . three . three corn fritters . two slices of toast and marmalade and a cuppa tea <all right> 
dare I ask you what you had for breakfast this morning ? 

Third speaker: um two weetbix 

1131SCN: a glass of water and a look around yip <oh right> and on the weekends it'll be bacon and egg . 

Interviewer 1131SCN: very good . great all right so we're nearly finished are you okay ? <yes> great . now 
just got this final passage for you to read aloud for me 
so it's not a test of reading skill so feel free to look through it first if you wish and then when you're ready just read that aloud -- 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . mm
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -- yes 
 all right thank you . all right so we're done there . it went okay didn't it 

1131SCN: is that it ? 

Interviewer 1131SCN: that's it . yip 

1131SCN: well . I don't know what you can get out of all that 

Interviewer 1131SCN: so which test was the hardest then <mm?> which test was the hardest --

1131SCN: the remembering the words when you want me to repeat them you know that really is . an ageing problem <mm> ah
