Interviewer 1212SCN: okay off you go now . 
the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he's nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
