 yes he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frotck . coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the mo~ utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest . upon a small organ

 we often urge him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
