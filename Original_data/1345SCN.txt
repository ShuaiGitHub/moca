 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect twice . 
each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language <oh> that's a new one
