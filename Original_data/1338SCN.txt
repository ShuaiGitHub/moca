Interviewer 1338SCN: now tell me about an early happy childhood memory - 

1338SCN:  standing out by the old gum tree singing my heart out 

Interviewer 1338SCN: just expand on that and talk for a few moments 
so we can look at your listen to your voice <right>

1338SCN: yes I used to love poetry and I was very good at remembering poems
and I used to go and stand outside by the outside um . 
looking over the ponds where the frogs would be croaking and reciting all these things like
great wide beautiful wonderful world to the world outside 

Interviewer 1338SCN: oh thank you . what did you have for brekfast? .

apricot and half maramlade and a cup of hot water with my pills .

Interviewer 1338SCN: um I'll get you to read this passage for me it's not a test of reading skill so you might
like to look at it first . just um let me know when you're ready to read it out loud .

1338SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers banana oil . grandfathers like to be modern in his language 
and I've left the s of the likes - 

Interviewer 1338SCN: we'll let you away with that so we've finished the recording it went ok didn't it? .
