1550SCN: yeah 

Interviewer 1550SCN: yep yep ok great - - ok so could you please read this passage . 
it's not a test of reading skill so you might want to have a wee look at it first . ah let me know when 
you're ready to read it aloud - -

1550SCN:  banana oil what I don't know what that means um right I'll read it then . 
the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short work walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
 I don't know I've never heard of banana oil before 

Interviewer 1550SCN: it's very strange <mmm> thank you . ok so we've finished the recording um it went well didn't it? . 

1550SCN: yeah <yeah> well I forgot is we I forgot I was being recorded actually worst yes 

Interviewer 1550SCN: ah so which test have you found the hardest .

1550SCN: oh um well it was no doubt about it . redrawing that very complicated . nonsense or whatever it was

Interviewer 1550SCN: the complicated figure <yeah>
