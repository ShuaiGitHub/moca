the grandfather passage - 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well . he's nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat - 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him . 
 a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -- 
 twice each day . he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . 
 but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
