 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ - except in winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
