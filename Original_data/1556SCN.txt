the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing oh dear a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observed him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully w~ and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
