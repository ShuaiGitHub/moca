and we went to the hospital to pick her up . and my father was driving the old car which we had then . 
and w~ as we drove home . I was sitting beside my mother who had the baby in her arms . 
and the baby was wrapped in a shawl and she was sucking her fingers . that were all covered in little bits of shawl 
and I remember thinking .
how disgusting but she doesn't know any better . and that was my attitude actually to my little sister for quite a long time

1127SCN:  that modern . um . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -- 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 
he's a great old guy isn't he 

Interviewer 1127SCN: it's funny isn't it
