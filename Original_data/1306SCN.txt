Interviewer 1306SCN: great . now um could you tell me about an early happy childhood memory -
tell me a wee story 

1306SCN: going to the beach with my father and mother and . two sisters --
was a weekly event - 
with our family during the summer . 
and my mother would pack up a picnic lunch and we'd drive over Mount Messenger . 
and to some - really lonely beach . 
along the coast of north Taranaki and . we would be highly offended if anyone else was there at all . 
and we would set up and . have a lovely lunch and play on the sand and swim the edge of the water .
but then my father would stand up - 
and walk to the sea and the girls we girls would all be terrified because he'd start to swim .
and swim and swim until he just became a dot in the distance and we would be . wound up with terror 
 until he came back and then we were happy <oh> . but he did it every week -
it's dangerous really . 

Interviewer 1306SCN: oh well that coastline's <yes> isn't it .

Interviewer 1306SCN:  swimming <yeah> thank you - now what did you have for breakfast today ? - 

1306SCN: something awful . because I had to go to South City quickly . and .
I wanted something to eat and I~ I wanted to have a coffee before I came and I .
didn't want to eat the muffins there so I got a sandwich and . 
yesterday's sandwich cheap in . 
in New World and it wasn't very nice it wasn't what I'd normally have 

Interviewer 1306SCN: yeah what do you like best for breakfast ? 

1306SCN: for breakfast I nearly always have -- 
a l~ a slice of heavy wholemeal bread . toasted . 
with about half an avocado spread on it - 
it's very very satisfying . 
an~ and good for you I think . 

Interviewer 1306SCN: great . now we're nearly finished are you okay ? 

1306SCN: and a latte <hmm> I go for a latte somewhere . everyday <oh very good> trim milk latte .

Interviewer 1306SCN: oh you're very fit looking you must do must be the right stuff 

1306SCN: it's the avocadoes I think 

Interviewer 1306SCN: so we're um we're almost finished are you okay <mm> -- 
what I'd like you to do now is to read this passage out . to me 
um it's not a test of reading skill <no> so you 
might want just to have a~ a look at it first and just let me know when you're ready to read it out loud .

: -- 

1306SCN: do you think I should look through it first or not <oh you're fine> I mean my impulse is to charge in

Interviewer 1306SCN: yeah good idea <right> 

1306SCN:  you wish to know all about my grandfather well . he's nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black fro~ frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we've often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer 1306SCN: great . so that's the recording part over and . done with it went okay didn't it . 

1306SCN: yeah w~ is it still recording 

Interviewer 1306SCN: oh is it -

1306SCN: um doing that . that thing again . that complicated sort of drawing 
<drawing the figure> again from memory yes <yes that was> I just found I just couldn't recall what . 
I knew there was appendages and things but I couldn't reme~
