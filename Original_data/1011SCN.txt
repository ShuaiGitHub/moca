the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather .
 well he is nearly ninety three years old .
 yet he still thinks as swissly~ swiftly as ever .
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
 twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day
 we have often urged him to walk . more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language --
