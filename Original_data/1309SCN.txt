1309SCN: the grandfather passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zeal upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
