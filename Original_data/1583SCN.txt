1583SCN:  . the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly n~ er ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language <> .

SL: thank you . - ok . so we've finished . the recording . er it went well didn't it?

SL: um . the drawing of it . or remembering it later on . 

1583SCN: both .
