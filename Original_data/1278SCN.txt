Interviewer 1278SCN: very good - - I want you to look at this passage it's not a test of reading skill . 
um so you might like to look at it first . let me know when you are ready to read it out loud . 

1278SCN:  oh yes - - you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is n~ 
ni~ nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often argued with him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
