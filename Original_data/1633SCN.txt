he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small or~ organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have an often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language . .
