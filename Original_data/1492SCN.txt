Interviewer (SL): it's not a test of reas~ reading skill so you might want to have a look at it first 
but just <it's all right> read it aloud when you're ready 

1492SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (SL): thank you -

Interviewer (SL): the complex figure? <yes> yip .
