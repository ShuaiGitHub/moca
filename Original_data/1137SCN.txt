he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard . clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .

we have often urged him to walk . more and smoke less but he always answered .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
