1339SCN: the grandfathers passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well .
he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced 
feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
