well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks likes . he still thinks
as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the 
open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answered
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
