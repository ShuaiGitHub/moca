1360SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk . walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - -
