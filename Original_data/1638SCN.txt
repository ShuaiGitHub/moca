1638SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with . zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and . smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

JD: yeah okay - - stop that .
