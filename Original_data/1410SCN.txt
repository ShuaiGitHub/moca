Interviewer (Amy): good . um . can you tell me about something funny that happened to you when you were growing up? .

1410SCN: --  
oh well I didn't think it was funny at the time but yes I remember when I was quite small 
ah l~ I slept in a cot until I was three or four - it was a very big - metal cot with . brass knobs on the corner .
and um - I must have been calling out in the evening after I'd been put to bed .
um . my father was in the room next door I think he had a visitor . and um - I must have been -
not going to sleep and calling out . and - 
um without saying a word my father came in and lifted me out of the cot and popped me out the window and shut the window and went away - 
now he didn't say a word . and I can't remember I presume I ran away round the house it wasn't quite dark 
and came in and I probably went to sleep after that but at the time I ah wondered what on earth had happened my father was a very 
gentle kind person he never . you know he never hurt me or did anything like that but he w s tired of me s~ calling out 
so um I remember that um . quite clearly <okay> 

Interviewer (Amy): <mm> thank you um what did you have for breakfast?

1410SCN: oh this morning oh I have what I usually have in the winter time porridge .
with milk and a little bit of sugar um raw sugar and then . th~ one slice of . ah . wholemeal toast . with marmite . 
half marmite and half lemon honey <okay> and I don't drink with my meals I will have . a cup of tea or coffee about an hour's t~ about an hour later

Interviewer (Amy): so now I'm just gonna get you to um to read this 

1410SCN: the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less - 
but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
that's lovely isn't it <thank you> 

Interviewer (Amy): um we've finished with the recording it went okay didn't it? <mm> 
kay so out of all the tests that we've done today which one was the hardest for you? --

1410SCN: which was the hardest - well drawing c~ that complicated picture from memory - I think was probably the hardest <mm>
