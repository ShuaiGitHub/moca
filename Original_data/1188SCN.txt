1188SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with seven with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a profound . pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day . he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when snow or ice prevents - he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
