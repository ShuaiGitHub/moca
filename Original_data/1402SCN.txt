ah . well this first thing that comes to mind is not particularly funny um . but um since it came to mind earlier on . 
I was playing . ah . to play in an annual rugby match between two colleges .
and ah I was late arriving for the game . ah I went on and played . and um tackled somebody badly and was concussed . 
and from a p~ that point on apparently I played um like a man possessed um . 
I've I had absolutely no recollection of what I did 

Interviewer (Simon): is that right ? oh wow so how much longer did you play for ? 

1402SCN: oh it wasn't all that long about ten minutes quarter of an hour

toast or maybe even bacon and eggs .

Interviewer (Simon): excellent very good . thank you . okay so we're nearly finished are you okay? 
excellent so now this here is the passage that I mentioned 
ah so it's not a test of reading skill so if you want to look through it first that's fine otherwise <mm> 
you can read that aloud when you're ready <kay>

1402SCN:  the grandfather- passage - 
 you wish to know about all about my grandfather well 
 he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he th~ still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer (Simon): excellent thank you very much . all right so we've finished the recording there so that part went okay didn't it 

1402SCN: yes

Interviewer (Simon): excellent . so which test have you found the hardest? - - 

1402SCN:  um I don't know that any of them . really . stretched me 

Interviewer (Simon): no that's excellent thank you very much
