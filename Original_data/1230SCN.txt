 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black froat . frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a   short
 short walk in the open air each day - we've often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
