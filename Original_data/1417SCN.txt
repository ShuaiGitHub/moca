1417SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old . black . frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the . o~ of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the . when s~ when the snow or ice prevents he s~ lowly takes a 
a short walk in the open air each day
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
