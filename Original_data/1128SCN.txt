Interviewer 1128SCN: okay . now can you tell me about an early happy childhood memory - 

1128SCN: oh I can remember . being on . a beach at a holiday . the beach called Langhome out from Auckland on the Manakau Harbour .
where we used to go for our annual holiday .
um . from mount Albert where we lived in Auckland and it was a lovely beach and we had a~ used to have a lovely time there swimming . 
diving off the rocks and carrying on . generally as kids do on beaches in New Zealand it was a very lovely time .
and we used to go there . I can't remember how often we went . from about . but I remember from the age of seven or eight .
through to . I suppose about thirteen fourteen - 
 clearly enough I'm timing it in terms of the second world war because ah we went before the war but then we were also
on holiday there just after the war was declared and we had . other young men who had . 
recently become soldiers and they were holidaying at the beach on final leave - 
and some of them were dead by the middle of the next year . um <mm> . 
but the holiday time was a lovely time at the beach . that enough <excellent> 

Interviewer 1128SCN: that's fine yes thank you . okay . now what did you have for breakfast this morning 

1128SCN: ah that's very easy cos I always have exactly the same 
porridge <excellent> . with soy milk . two pieces of toast the first one with vegemite the second one marmalade .
and orange juice . <yum> and my pills that I have to take at breakfast time <okay> and that was all I had for breakfast <right> no butter 

Interviewer 1128SCN: all right and what do you like best for breakfast 

1128SCN: all of those things 

Interviewer 1128SCN: all those we're getting that quite a lot in this . excellent . so we're nearly finished are you okay ? . 

1128SCN: yes do you want to know those words again 

Interviewer 1128SCN: no no not quite as I said I wasn't doing anything 

1128SCN: oh and here I am spending time with remembering them 

Interviewer 1128SCN: quite that cruel 
okay . now just the final thing I've got for you here is just this passage <yup> 
now it's not a test of reading skill so feel free to read through it first if you wish <yup> and when you're ready just read that aloud 

1128SCN: okay - 
 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he s~ plays skilfully . and with zest . upon a small organ . 
 except . in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil - 
 fa~ grandfather . likes to be modern in his language -- 

Interviewer 1128SCN: thank you . all right so we're done <oh good> that went okay didn't it <yeah> cool . so which test was the hardest . 

1128SCN: oh as I said I think along the road I've never been very happy about drawing things I -- that dates back~
