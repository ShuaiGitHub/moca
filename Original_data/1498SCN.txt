1498SCN: the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still looks as swiftl~ thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced 
feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
