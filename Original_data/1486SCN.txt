1486SCN: okay . the grandfather passage - 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him -
a pronounced feeling of the m~ utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except . in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
