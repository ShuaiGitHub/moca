1024SCN: the grandfather passage
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old frock . old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard . clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling . of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest . upon a small organ .
except in winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him . to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
