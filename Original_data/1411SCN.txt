1411SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather well .
he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling .
of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully .
and with a zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or pr~ or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have nofen~ we have often urged 
him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
