1389SCN: okay . the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in . the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answered banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

um . what what the original one looks like I've got a vague idea but to actually 
repeat it line for line is extremely difficulty <it's difficult> mm <yeah
