1004SCN: ah yes -

one that I remember . pretty distinctly um I was I think about . 
eight or nine and we had . 
we lived on a farm and um we had . 
two puppies there was a . a farm dog <mhmm> that . that 
herded the . cows in <yeah>
and the dog had pups and my brother and I were allowed to keep a pup each 
so . we . kept these pups and spoilt them rotten . 
um and mu~ mu~ --
I~ I'm sure it was my brother now I must have been older than eight or nine cos he was driving a jeep 
he was we had a jeep on the farm as well <mm> 
um and he backed the jeep out of a . garage and . accidentally . knocked . 
went over one of these pups <ooh> but didn't kill it . 
um and it was lying there thrashing round on the ground and my father brought out a . 
a slasher to . hit it on the head .
and I was ah I remember saying <oh> no no he might be all right <yeah> but he wasn't . 
<oh> well yes that was a childhood memory

was quite a bit younger . <yeah> and she . 
didn't really know what had happened or how <yeah> it had happened . 
and I remember telling her walking round the back of the farm <yeah> .
and she sort of commiserated said what an awful memory to have of this place <I know>

Interviewer 1004SCN: I think it's probably 

1004SCN: so 

Interviewer 1004SCN: it would~ would have stuck there because it was obviously . something traumatic . yeah

1004SCN: I'm . sorry . it's . yes it's n~ not a nice memory but I I
I have got better memories than that <yeah> but that was the one that sprung to mind 

Interviewer 1004SCN: I think you tend to remember the really good things . or the not so good things <yes yes> 
and most of the . ordinary stuff in the middle <yes> you don't remember

in total detail 

1004SCN: yes . most most 

Interviewer 1004SCN: peculiar things yeah

1004SCN: peculiar things . especially then
where it because we spent a bit of time the . the .

1004SCN:  um 
 the grandfather passage . 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather? . 
 well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several bus~ buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in winter when the snow or ice prevents he takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often uged him to walk more and smoke less but he always says banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer 1004SCN: it's quite <yes> funny isn't it

1004SCN: never heard banana oil before

Interviewer 1004SCN: I know I think it's the the standard thing they get everyone to read <yes> so they can p~ compare it's quite funny 
um . yeah so we're done so <ah> that went okay didn't it <right yes yes> 

1004SCN: it was fine 

Interviewer 1004SCN: so which test was the hardest -

1004SCN: um probably the reproducing the 

Interviewer 1004SCN: the one that I did~ meanly didn't tell <yes> you to remember excellent okay so I'm going to push st~
