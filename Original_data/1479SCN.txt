1479SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those that observe
who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
