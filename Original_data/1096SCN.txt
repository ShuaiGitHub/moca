 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly twenty th~ ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be . modern in his language .
