ended up in the Waimak river and 
he had hold of my foot cos he thought he was going to lose me

it's not a test of reading skill so you might just like to skip over it first 
and then just start reading when you're ready . 

1525SCN: mmm - - you wish 
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk 
in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
 . 

Interviewer 1525SCN: <that's quite funny really> thank you alright so we've finished the recording now that went ok didn't it?

1525SCN: yep

1525SCN: um . probably drawing that stupid thing from memory 

Interviewer 1525SCN:  that's quite hard isn't it
