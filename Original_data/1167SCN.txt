1167SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer 1167SCN: cool thank you <mm>
