please it's not a test of reading skill <no> so you might like to look at it first .
just let me know when you're ready .

1497SCN: I'm ready now <mhmm great> the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - never heard of that one - 

Interviewer (Anne): that's good so we've finished the recording that went okay didn't it? 

1497SCN: yeah it's fine 

Interviewer (Anne): and um so which test have you found the hardest? 

1497SCN: ah redrawing that . complicated shape <ahah> .

Interviewer (Anne): that one's . got many
