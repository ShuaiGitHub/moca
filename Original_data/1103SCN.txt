well . he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself . in an old black . frock coat usually with seven 
several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of . utmost respect .
twice each day . he plays skilfully . with a zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes . a short walk . in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his . language .
