<yip> the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well . he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
ah we have . often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always says banana oil .
grandfather likes to b~be modern in his language -

<face> cos if I if I don't have to remember it I forget it <exactly> I don't m~ keep it up there for no reason <yip> . 

Interviewer 1009SCN: you don't want to fill up any space with anything you don't need <that's right yup>

Interviewer 1009SCN: it's a good way to be
