Interviewer (Amy): good okay can you tell me something funny that happened to you when you were growing up? -

1396SCN: something funny . ah . something funny - 
I don't remember anything too hilarious happening to me when I was growing up - 

Interviewer (Amy): I mean if you can't remember a funny memory maybe just something oh something about your childhood 

1396SCN: oh well I can remember plenty of things about my childhood I just don't remember anything that was particularly funny .

Interviewer (Amy): well can you tell me about maybe a childhood memory then?

1396SCN: okay um . one childhood memory that comes very quickly to mind is um . 
breaking my leg as a seven year old - 
and I was inside um a boat and it had an inboard motor - 
and as I walked past the motor 
the belt on the motor dragged my leg into the engine 
<oh> and twisted it around until it snapped and did all sorts of interesting things . 
yes and we were right down in the Queen Charlotte Sounds which was a five hour launch trip - 
to the port and the launch had dirty petrol and it took us nine hours to get there <oh> .
and when we got there the ambulan~ ambulance was waiting from Blenheim 
and the roads were clay and it had been raining and we slid from one side of the road to the other to get to the hospital 
I don't know how my poor mother didn't pass out on the spot .
but I was sedated there was a a doctor down there and I was sedated so I didn't really know much of what was going on but I was
still aware of all the happenings
and it was a long long healing process they were going to amputate my leg <must be>

Interviewer (Amy): quite painful

1396SCN: well it was um .
interesting at the time I think as a child you don't remember the pain you were probably do~ 
doped up to the eyeballs but I went to school in hospital I remember that and going to 
there was Bugs Bunny cartoon on the door of the school and having to do maths and English and . 
I was in hospital for four months . and they did save my leg .
my knee's a bit odd <mm> but they did save my leg instead of chopping it off . for which I am very grateful .
 so that'll that's one memory that stays with me quite well <thank you> 

Interviewer (Amy): thank you <it's okay> um what did you have for breakfast? . 

1396SCN: I had um natural yoghurt Clearwater natural yoghurt . 
with that I had a chopped up kiwifruit and half a banana 
and my soaked seeds and I soak flaxseed linseed and pumpkin seeds overnight until they swell and I mix them all together 
that's what you call a healthy breakfast 

Interviewer (Amy): kay what do you like best for breakfast?

1396SCN: I don't mind I'd like to eat great mountains of toast
but it's too carbohydrate oriented so I refrain and I also have quinoa porridge 
and put the same things in that 
sometimes millet porridge . 
just whatever I feel like at the time or how much time I've got to eat it before I have to fly out the door 

Interviewer (Amy): okay good ah we're nearly finished with the recording are you okay?

1396SCN: absolutely fine 

Interviewer (Amy): kay good so now I'm just gonna get you to read this um passage for me <certainly) --

1396SCN: okay the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather well 
he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer (Amy): okay thank you - um so we have finished with the recording it went okay didn't it?

1396SCN: absolutely yeah fine 

Interviewer (Amy): so out of all the tests that we've done today <mm> which one was the hardest? 

1396SCN: oh well that having to emulate th~ copy that 
copy that dratted diagram that was the only one
