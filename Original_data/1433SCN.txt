I've got this passage here which I'd like you to read it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first .
just let me know when you're ready to read it aloud .

1433SCN: -- 
not yet . I'm a slow reader <okay that's alright> -- okay . 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (Anne): thank you . right we've finished the recording . that went okay didn't it <mm> 
so which test was the hardest? - today 

1433SCN: of the whole <mm> . ah redrawing that complicated diagram
