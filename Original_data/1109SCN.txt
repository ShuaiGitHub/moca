and two boys my brother was one year older than me so he was 
ten and I was nine or something like that . right . anyway
. this house was partly . partly built . but the roof wasn't . totally on . 
and there was a huge beam running across the living room .

1109SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a profound feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1109SCN: excellent thank you . ok so we're done . <ok> went ok didn't it
