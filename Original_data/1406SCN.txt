the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
