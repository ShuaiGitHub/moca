1388SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather -
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk .
in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language --

1388SCN: oh well the one that I couldn't remember .
