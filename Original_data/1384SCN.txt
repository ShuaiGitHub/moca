Interviewer 1384SCN: so just you know maybe when you were about nine or nine to twelve or something around there - - 
can you think of anything funny that your sisters may have done or

1384SCN: well I spose it's funny to look back on on now but um we used to 
as a family go eeling in our cow paddock 

Interviewer 1384SCN: ok 

1384SCN: and ah more often . than not . it . was . dark and it was summer time . and . we . 
used to ah . come across the odd odd cow pat wh~ which was . nice and warm 
and ah b~ a b~ bit wet . um . there was always . 
I suppose a bit of a yell and a squeal about that 
and and um - the other thing I can think about is
while we're eeling it was the um . some we used to have a . um .
what we called a four gallon kerosene tin . um . with . 
one of the long sides cut out of it . and inside that we would have a candle
that would be to attract the eels . and um - -
sometimes unf~ unfortunately for me there was a eel on the bank . and I . um .
used to . be I did get a bit scared about it I spose it's . 
wasn't funny at the time but um the feeling of a 
slimey eel underfoot was n~ not much fun . 
not much fun at the time but I can laugh about it now . 
and I guess that's not really what you're looking for is it 
the p~ <no it's good > funny for me to look back on now <it is> yes . 
and ah yes . so um - you know as a as a group of kids mum was always there with us of course
ah but those were the kind of . fun things I can look back on now and that um 
that a lot of kids don't miss out on now yes <eeling> yes . ah . 
wasn't I ah never eat a eel but I can remember my eldest sister and her boyfriend . 
cooking some up in our kitchen and I'm sure . they told me that it's .
the pieces would still have nerves in it or something and the~ and it would 
jump around in the pan 
 so . I guess I guess it was a tall story

1384SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well 
 he is . nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - 
 he dresses himself in an old black frot frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him 
 a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully . 
 and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
