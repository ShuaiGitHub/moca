almost every holiday except the May holidays which were a bit colder . 
and we had wonderful times in the sand hills and the beach . 
ah up the trees . all those sort of things that young fellows like to do when they're . 
or young boys like to do when they're small . um .

the grandfather passage . you wish to know about my grandfather . well . 
he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old frock black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . 
banana oil grandfather likes to be modern in his language - -
