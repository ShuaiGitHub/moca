the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather -
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronfound feeling of the utmost respect -
twice daily he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevent .
he slowly walks a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language <hmm>
