I have a brother who lives in Dunedin and my sister is in Blenheim .
when I was twelve years old we came out as an immigrant family -
and with hindsight my parents would have spent the same amount of 
money if they had paid their own way . 
and we would have been able to bring out a bit more luggage

well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still think he's a . he thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the 
utmost respect . twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
