1603SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short w~ . walk . in the open air each day . 
we have often o~ . urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

1603SCN: yes
