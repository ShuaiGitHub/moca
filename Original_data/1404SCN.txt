1404SCN: oh -- 
I come off a farm originally and - 
we were - um - killing some poultry for the house - 
and . I cut the head off a chicken . and the chicken flew away . 
because of the um nervous reaction after it had its head chopped off - 
and I remember as a child being petrified that perhaps this chicken was still alive even though it had no head - 
so I think that's probably what just something briefly I can remem~ recount <okay>

Interviewer (Amy): okay so now I'm gonna get you to read this um passage for me --

1404SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard cli~ clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents.
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer (Amy): okay thank you . we have finished with the recording it went okay didn't it? --
