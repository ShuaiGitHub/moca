well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilful~ skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day
