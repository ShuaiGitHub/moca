<right> so it's not a test of reading skills so feel free <no no no> to look through it first
and away you go 

1258SCN:  right . the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer 1258SCN: excellent thank you <right> alright so we're done there so that went ok didn't it?

1258SCN: yep . no problem .
