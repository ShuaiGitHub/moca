1265SCN:  the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a profound feeling of utmost respect . 
 twice every day he plays skilfully and with z~ zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he a~ always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
