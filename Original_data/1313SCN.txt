he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black fro~ frock coat usually with seven buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving thosed who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil .
