first let me know when you are ready to read aloud - - 

1156SCN: ok - the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks very swiftly as ever - - 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully .
with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk .
more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
