unfortunately . on . Christmas eve . when the carol singers . came round . 
my father got up to go out and ah 
and make a donation because they had come fairly late to our house . 
and he fell over the tricycle . and he was very upset about this . 
and by the time he had ah ah disentangled himself from the tricycle and got out to the . 
to the ah to the front door the carol singers had gone . so he'd . 
ran off down the street . in his pyjamas - 
to give them the donation . now is that the sort of thing you wanted?

a bit of everything - <okay> if I had time I would make porridge but -- <mhmm>

Interviewer (Amy): kay we're nearly finished <mhmm> are you okay? <yes mhmm> good . 
so now I'm just gonna get you to read um - this passage for me -- 

1478SCN: the grandfather passage -
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several bus~ buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day --
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -- 

Interviewer (Amy): okay thank you . um we have finished with the recording <mhmm> it went okay didn't it?

1478SCN: I think so mm

Interviewer (Amy): it did <mm> so um - out of all the tests that we've done today which one was the hardest? - 

1478SCN: ah the one I failed . ah and that was the one with the five . words . 
cos I reminded myself of them . 
once or twice during the time we were doing the intervening tests . 
and I thought yes that's the trick 
you tell yourself about them and then when the time came
I think perhaps the thing that put it out of my mind might have been doing the -
the drawing . cos there's so much concentration required on <mhmm> don't know anyway
