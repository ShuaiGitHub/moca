1335SCN: the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well . he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several but~ buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him 
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully .
and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
