1420SCN: when I was growing up? 

Interviewer (JW): yeah when you were growing up yip . 

1420SCN: um one thing . perhaps perhaps the earliest vivid . memory that I have is ah 
when I was four when nineteen forty five when we had a 
massive snowfall - 
here in Christchurch . <mm> and ah it was -- 
I can . I can remember vividly dad pulling the curtains and letting me see it .
and then . um a few days later we had a hell of a flood and my f~
grandfather rowed a boat . all the way up Aylesford street 
to bring dad some gumboots <boy . that's amazing>
so I do remember that and it had to be when I was four because i~ we moved from that house to
Wanganui when I was five <yeah wow> yeah - 

Interviewer (JW): that's pretty cool . did you get to play in the snow? . 

1420SCN: oh yeah yeah yeah I ah um . 
the details of that aren't so much there but I can remember . um . 
oh I can just remember the shock and the stark . 
looking out the window and suddenly you see you know what was green is . 
grey you know the s~ the grey 
th~ th~ the grey um

Interviewer (JW): oh because it would have been a lot of snow

Interviewer (JW): well. soun~ well what do you like best for breakfast? - 

1420SCN: oh look I like a cooked breakfast um

realise perhaps it's not the sort of thing you should be doing when you're . 
no so busy in life and . stacking up on food but we sometimes
go out and take grandchildren for breakfast yeah you know <nice> 
it's quite nice

so you might like to look at it first . and let me know when you are ready to read it aloud -- 

1420SCN: I'm just having a bit of trouble with my eyes you know what it's like

1420SCN: okay <good> you just want me to read it <yip> .

Interviewer (JW): when you're ready .

1420SCN: the grandfathers . passage -
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself . in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several button~ . buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling . of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes . 
 a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil -
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer (JW): thank you . well we have finished the recording . it went okay didn't it .

1420SCN: did it? oh <yeah it did> yeah it wasn't didn't cause too much pain <yeah>

Interviewer (JW): well . so which test have you found the hardest? - 

1420SCN: um --
th~ probably remembering that drawing and ah . 
I'm surpr~ prised I didn't get the five words you know that .

Interviewer (JW): you only missed one <huh?> 

1420SCN: <yeah> I think I've got them again now but 

Interviewer (JW): it was okay it wasn't that bad . 
<yeah> oh well thank you very much for that <that's all>
