1032SCN: um . the grandfathers passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents he slowly . takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we often . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
gran~ grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
