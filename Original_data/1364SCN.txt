he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
