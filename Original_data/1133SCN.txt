windy road we had to wait for the cars coming down becasue it was a . a one way road . 
and when we got part way up the top . there was a lot of snow . 
which meant the car in front of us got stuck which meant we got stuck which meant everybody had to get out and push . 
until we got u[ to the . um I can't remember the name of the . it wasn't the hermitage it's got a different name and it's probably not there now . 
um - and then we walked up the mountain for a while and .

1133SCN: ah I'll just do it . the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . oh that's good
