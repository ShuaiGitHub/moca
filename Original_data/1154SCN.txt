1154SCN: oh that's good um - I used to live on a farm and I used to enjoy going out rabbit hunting . 
and um . certain things like that . and possum shooting . and ah .
whenever I probably . got tired of getting locked up I'd go for a wander round the farm and . 
work around so those were the sort of things that I quite enjoyed doing . 
and um . yeah . driving the tractor when I shouldn't be and things like that - 
 how much longer do you want me to keep going 

Interviewer 1154SCN: if you can tell me a bit more that would be really good <laugh oh> .
cos we're trying to <ah> aiming for two minutes .

1154SCN: oh going for two minutes oh right ok then I um . 
yes I mentioned I was born on a farm and we were well out from Invercargill . 
well in those days were well out now days probably twenty miles wouldn't be . 
far out anyway . but it was all on gravel roads and we . 
and I think we enjoyed going to town once a week . 
and running round the city and going home in our little old car we had .
um . we also had . cows on the farm . we used to milk them .
ah . my younger days when we started off in the first few years . 
I would ah be . we'd milk 'em by hand till we got 
power cos power didn't get out to our place for a wee while . 
ah so that was . one or two of the things . 
and I can remember one thing that I really enjoyed and .
one whole christmas holidays . it didn't rain once 
<by & int: wow> and that's Southland for you now now don't

and let me know when you are ready to read aloud - -

1154SCN: oh yeah it's alright . yeah I'm ready <ok> -
the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those .
who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully 
and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 
. banana oil . it's a new one on me <laugh>
thought you'd say 

Interviewer 1154SCN: k we're done
