1599SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know . all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing . his long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often herg~ urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - -
