he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of . utmost respect .
twice each year he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
