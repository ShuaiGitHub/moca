yes okay . it's quite fun .
the grandfather passage - you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully w~ and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1035SCN: okay . well we're all done <oh well> ah that went okay didn't it 

1035SCN: yeah . it was quite fun <good good> quite unexpected but .
