Interviewer 1155SCN: yes thank you <1155: ok>

1155SCN:  you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard . clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he's plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
