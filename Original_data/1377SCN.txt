Interviewer 1377SCN: . Ann . participant one three seven seven S C N . please count to ten - 

1377SCN: one two three four five six seven eight nine ten .

Interviewer 1377SCN: now could you tell me something funny or amusing that happened to you or even a friend when you were growing up .
a little story about . 

1377SCN: well it's not a little story but it's I a very clear memory when I was at kindergarten - 
which is probably the reason why I went straight to um . further up the ladder . um .
it was a private kindergarten . and it was in Mansfield Avenue . called Ms Twinems Lesley Twinems I think it was
anyway um . there was a girl who lived in the same street as myself . but . along . 
it was a long street and she lived at the other end and she went to this kindergarten too - -
and one day we were playing in the um i~ t~ . a rest period or . play period .
and we were climbing this tree and she pushed me out of it . couldn't have been very . tall tree -
and . I was furious I think it was the first time in my life I'd probably been 
treated too kindly by my parents and my brothers . and it was the first time in my life that I thought . 
you know that's . not right I'm going to do something about 
this so I climbed up on the tree and waited til she was in the same position and heaved her off .
and I've never forgotten that because we've been friends ever since I still see her . 
ah cos she came to the same secondary school as I did 
later I didn't see her for years and years and then she came and she was at the same secondary school but her father . 
took her away from there because he decided she wasn't learning anything when he came back from the war . 
and um . but later on . through a s~ a school centenary I met her again . 
and the minute we saw one another we talked about how we'd pushed one another out of the tree . 
but I think it was a turning point of my life funnily enough . because .
I hadn't struck anything like this before <mmm> and it decided w~ which way I was going to react . 
was going to be very important either I . caved in and thought oh well she's bigger than me 
or else I decided to find do something about it . 
so but it's so funny when it's it's clear as clear now and all sorts of other things have disapeared into the ether
but isn't it ridiculous how funny things 

Interviewer 1377SCN: that's something to be proud of <w~> you made a decision and in your young life 

1377SCN: well I think . um - yes and my I mean my brothers had a~ taught me you know that I was meant to take care of myself 
you didn't ever cry ever ever no matter what happened you didn't ever cry . so I was . toughened up by them I spose
and I thought I dunno it was just . something I had to do at that age I mean I must have been quite young .
but I remember thinking I've got to . do something here . 

Interviewer 1377SCN: ah it's a good story thank you 

1377SCN: it's not very funny but it's just . except that whenever we see one another we laugh about it you know 

Interviewer 1377SCN: well I can imagine it's a good a good point of laughing <yes> um now Faith what did you have for breakfast? .

1377SCN: I had porridge . and I had one slice of toast . and I had um . vegemite 
and honey and marmalade on it and a cup of tea .

Interviewer 1377SCN: ready

1377SCN: mmm <mmm hmm>
 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he's nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost .   respect
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
