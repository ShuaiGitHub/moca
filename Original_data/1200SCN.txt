1200SCN: want me to read it out ? <yes please> the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language <okay thank you> --
