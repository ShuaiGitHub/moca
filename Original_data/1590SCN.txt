and a horse . towing you know towing the trailor thing . and we used to hide and pretend that there was something out on the road 
with <mmm> string attached . and he'd stop to pick it up and we'd <yes> . pull it back through the fence . and then giggle . 
he used to get a do~ bit annoyed with us I think

1590SCN: well until I turned sixty five I found it very very difficult . <yeah?> cos when my husband was sick <oh> I looked after him I s~ gave up work 
for six years <mmm> to look after him . and . when he'd passed away that was alright until he passed away and when he passed away I was 
on a widow's benefit

JW: mmm

1590SCN: and . that was extremely difficult . and . because of my leg I wasn't really physically fit . enough <mmm> to helv~ have a job but I .
<mmm> I did try to work I had <yip> two jobs last year . which were very . short . <mmm> one was looking after an Alzheimer's - 
er wife and a dementia husband . and I found that too psychologically . stressful <yeah> . I couldn't . cos I had no training in that area
<mmm> but they didn't ask for somebody . that was trained they just asked for somebody to . look after them <yip> 
and I I couldn't cope with that and I also got a little part time . um . job at the kindy . d~ um . Kidsfirst I think it was called
Kidsfirst um <yip> kindy . but um . oh my leg half an hour after I'd been there I could~ <yeah> I was dragging so I just wasn't physically up to it .
and the pain <mmm yeah> you know <no you don't wanna> I just wasn't . comfortable . so they didn't renew my contract 
but that was no surprise to me

1590SCN: oh . this morning? <mmm> - um - - plain yoghurt . with tuna - mixed up . <> and it's yummy . .

JW: I'm gonna take your word for that . <yeah> 

1590SCN: very yummy . I used to have it everyday <> and then . I got . well they thought I got gout in one of my joints . <yip> and . 
the doctor said oh if it's gout . maybe you're eating too much tuna and . . and natural yoghurt you know too much protein and that but . 
and oils but it wasn't . that <yip> it wasn't gout it n~ negative came back negative <oh good> so um . but I cut back on the fish <mmm>

1590SCN: yeah . 

JW: are you okay?

1590SCN: yeah . 

JW: okay . well could you read this passage please . now it's not a test of reading skill so you might . like to have a look at it first
<mmm> and . let me know when you're ready to read it aloud . 

1590SCN: and . would you like me to read it like I was reading it to somebody to make it interesting - 
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern . in his language . 

JW: thank you . well we've finished the recording . it went okay didn't it?

1590SCN: yeah yeah . yeah 

JW: so which test have you found the hardest? - -

1590SCN: probably that one about trying to think about something . funny . y~ you know . f~ funny or mu~ amusing cos . yeah .

1590SCN: yeah <well>
