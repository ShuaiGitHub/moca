1500SCN: the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old dark -
an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we often we often urge him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . 
banana oil grandfather likes to be modern in his language
