1311SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
 usually with several buttons missing - a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - - 
 we've often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
