TRANSCRIPT

JW: . okay this is . Jillian Watson . with participant number one five four seven . SCN . on the . fifth of August - two thousand and eleven -
could you please count to ten . 

1547SCN: one . two . three . four . five . six . seven . eight . nine . ten 

JW: excellent . now can you tell me about something funny or amusing that happened to you . or even a friend when you were growing up - . - -

1547SCN: um - - 

JW: a dinner party story - 

1547SCN: nothing comes to mind . perhaps nothing happened . um - - put on the spot like this you can never . bring one to mind . 

JW: well what . what do you dine out on then . what's your dinner story when you go out to dinner parties - 

1547SCN: I listen . 

JW: if you ha~ if you . were gonna tell a story at a dinner party what would you tell - -

1547SCN: I'll . tell you a little . recent anecdote . <mmm> um . that's probably not quite up to your . requirement but I . spent last week . 
in Sydney . and I was staying over at Manly . at a place called . a Q station . which was where the original quarantine . station was . 

JW: mmhmm .

1547SCN: and . this is um . a national park now and they've preserved . as many of the original buildings . th~ . 
that were put up over a . a hundred and fifty or so years . as they . have . been able to - one of the . features of the . um
attractions there is that they offer a ghost tour - and - I . put myself down . one evening . for the ghost tour - 
and it started at seven o'clock at night . and at this time of the year . it was dark . then - we had . hurricane lanterns . given to us . um .
to carry around . between . one between two - however there were two young couples myself and the guide who was a . young woman .
and she'd been doing this for some years - and she gave us an introductory talk on how to recognise ghosts . um . 
the brushing of the . spider w~ . cobweb against the face the . tap on the shoulder the . touch on the hand of the . 
of the child wanting attention - and we set off around the . various buildings . these two . young couples had been there . um prior to this - 
and they'd brought along their digital cameras - and so all the way . they were snapping these bloody cameras looking for ghostly images
to be captured . on the camera . that couldn't be seen by the naked eye - I've - I am familiar with some people who have psychic ab~ .
abilities and . and I'm . sympathetic to . the idea that um . we can be reincarnated . and . so ghosts . per se don't . don't worry me . 
but I was unable to . experience . anything . like that because of the . constant chatter of these two couples as they . 
smashed their cameras against everything they could find and . thoroughly irritated me and drove the . guide . to desperation . 
so we'd go up into the er hospital building and we'd s~ be standing there amongst the old beds <mmm> and she would say over in that bed 
a medium has seen a woman lying there . um . and over here there's been a young child . and over there um . 
somebody goes through the door and comes back again and goes out again - but . it was impossible to experience any of these .
things because of the disturbance caused by . <mmm> these two couples so that was a somewhat disappointing experience - 

JW: well thank you for that - that's a thank you . what did you have for breakfast? -

1547SCN: this morning . I had my breakfast - - of muesli . yoghurt - milk . er calcium enriched . and a banana . and that has been consistent . 
for probably . eight or ten years . <mmhmm> . I like the calcium enriched because . one time . probably um . 
seven or eight years ago I was in Canada . in Seattle . er sorry not Canada Austra~ America - waiting for er . to see a colleague of my wife's .
and in the building across the road where there was a coffee shop . in the foyer of this building . there was a public health . 
testing service where they were . doing for diabetes and various other things . and I asked <mmm> them . whether they would . 
be prepared to accept a foreigner . and they said sure so I got my . tests done and one of the things was a er . 
it was a er . scan . of the bone density in my . <mmm hmm> heel - and they commented on . how . much better condition . 
my bone was than the . person of my age normally would be . <> and I attribute that to the fact that we .
always use the calcium enriched milk . 

JW: excellent . well we're nearly finished - are you okay? . 

1547SCN: I'm fine . 

JW: excellent . now . could you please read this passage . it is not a test of reading skill . so you might like to look at it first .
and let me know when you're ready to read it aloud - -

1547SCN:  the grandfather passage - you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

JW: thank you . well . we have finished the recording . it went okay didn't it? .

1547SCN: as far as I'm aware .

JW: so which test have you found the hardest? - - 

1547SCN: the um . reproduction of er . previous - - utuilised . images or . something of that order . <mmhmm> recall of things 

JW: yes - well thank you for that
