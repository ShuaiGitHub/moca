Interviewer 1370SCN: good ok now tell me about something funny or amusing that happened to you um when you were growing up .

1370SCN: oh my gosh 

Interviewer 1370SCN: maybe something that happened to a~ at school . <no> or a family holiday -

1370SCN: funny - um - 

Interviewer 1370SCN: if you can't think of something 
<no I can't> then maybe just something <we weren't that sort of family> from your childhood

1370SCN: s~ something happened in my childhood . um - well this will be something anyway . um - 
I was born just before the war started I was sixth months old when World War Two broke out . 
so my father was called up . later in very l~ . at the end of the year . 
and so when I was growing up we used to go and stay quite a lot with my maternal grandmother .
who lived . not far away about - twenty thirty miles away something like that . 
had to get a train to get there . steam train . 
as a~ as a result I grew up loving steam trains still do . 
um . so we used to go and stay . my mother and I with her . she was a widow by then - 
and she had this small . 
farm which her brother used to run for her but she still had chickens and . 
farm buildings were there . and I loved it because - um . 
I go out and gather mushrooms in the morning and collect the eggs from the chickens 
cos I gr~ lived in a . 
um . suburb of a small town market town . on the east coast of England .
and I had a lot of freedom there . um . my parents were q~
reasonably protective of me growing up 
they were very worried because there was a river at the end of the garden
there was a railway not far away and there was a . a road acro~ outside the house . 
a very quiet road but a road none the less . but when I used to stay with my grandmother . 
um . I used to wander through the fields and do all sorts of things and nobody worried about me
my mother grandmother used to say . um . 
don't go near the cow and then she used to say well they won't allow you to get near them anyway
 . um . so there was all all sorts of things to do and I was 
quite used to entertaining myself because I was an only child til I was almost seven years old
. my brother arrived after my father was . um . um . 
s~ so and it was I remember one of the things
yeah there's all sorts of things they rigged up a a swing for me in inside one of the um .
place that used to keep the cattle in . quite some years before all cleaned out now . 
fun like that . but at the same time
very much still aware that there was a war going on 
cos this was on the east coast of England <mmm> and near the .
um North Sea between us and . Germany - and I can remember one particular . um going down . 
well one particular occasion at night . um for some reason I woke up and I went down stairs . 
and it it would have been summer . and um 
my pare~ my mother and grandmother weren't in the house 
and I thought where are they so I went out . and they were stood outside .
um out little way outside at the back door 
and they were looking up in the sky and they were looking at the search lights .
um which they'd . I mean in the country you didn't have things like in town you got a warning
if there was a . a planes coming in <mmm mmm> . and you also got the all clear afterwards 
similar srien but different sound . but in the in a country area you didn't get that 
all you heard was the sound of the planes 
and sometimes the anti-aircraft guns cos there was that not that far in you know .
town not far from us . and . 
and they were watching the search lights and they used to beam like this huge torches up in the air 
trying to get the planes in it . and ah - 
and then after that you know they decided oh it was alright there was nothing round there 
they go back to bed <ok> for the night . 
yeah I don't know I could talk about that for ages 
<that's alright> you've finally had enough <we need about two> I do think I have a
New Zealand accent I don't I say ten not ten

1370SCN: oh the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 

Interviewer 1370SCN: um that <yeah> that must be the MRI <yeah> scanner downstairs 

1370SCN: usually with several buttons missing nearly had them both missing there 
ah strong table sorry a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
I haven't heard that one before <ok good> 

Interviewer 1370SCN: um yeah we tend to get those sort of like .
