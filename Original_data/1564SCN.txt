1564SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chi~ chin . giving those who observe him a profound feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

JW: well thank you very much
