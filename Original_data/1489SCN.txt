the grandfather passage -
you wish to know all about my grandfather -
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black f~ black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully .
and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
