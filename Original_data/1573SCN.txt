I always felt was ah funny and vaguely ironical was um growing up at a small country school where there were very few
so called discipline problems . but um . one day . Eric Taylor who came from a family of thirteen
um was hit on the head at lunch time . with a brick by Patrick Hinga . a~ and Patrick . 
um had a few siblings it Patrick um . oh sometimes wasn't the brightest spark 
but however I always think it was quite funny and ironical that 
when asked to explain infront of us all who were awe struck that 
this had happened nothing ever happened like that at our school . 
he said 'well I did it because I thought he was a baddy' and he was actually on the same side 
 so yeah so that was the rationale for it and he wasn't a baddy at all so yeah

1573SCN: mmm hmm mmm hmm . ok .
 the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who obs~ observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .   twice
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we've often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
