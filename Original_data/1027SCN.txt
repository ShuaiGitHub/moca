he dresses him~ himself in an old black frock coat
usually with several . buttons missing . 
a long . beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully a~ and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow and~ or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often . urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
