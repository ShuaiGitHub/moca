as   swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the upmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when he when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day - we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
