a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully w~ a~ and with a zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
