he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents
