always immaculate didn't matter what she did she was immaculate we both leave the gate .
of the house where we lived . 
walk up to the corner and as soon as I turned the corner I'd take my shoes off 
tie them in a knot and a~ sling them round my neck .
wh~ come home . I came home like a raggamuffin and my sister
came home exactly as she left that morning . <mmm> 
and if I heard once . I heard it a thousand times why can't you be more like your sister - -

1054SCN: oh no that was often a memory I remember taking a 
doll to we had a big drain in well it was huge wh~ wh~ when I was growing up 
but when I went back to look at it not terribly long ago it's not a very deep drain <oh>
a drain that ran right through our street . and um . 
I took her doll it's name was Pam and I took it 
down there I don't know why I would have taken it down the drain I used to play in the drain
you normally only had a . ah if the drain was say
ten feet wide it only had about 
a one foot wide stream going through it and we used to jump over it 
throw balls over it cos it was all concrete <mmm> . 
and I took her doll down there and some other kids down there took it off me 
and remember feeling how sad she was I'd lost her doll <oh>
still makes me feel sad <mmm> mmm . so that's an early memory that's enough .

you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black k~ frock k~ coat .
usually with . the buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a 
pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice a day he plays skilfully -
oh it's spelt wrong . and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice 
prevents he slowly takes a short w~ walk in the open air each day .
we have urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
you've spelt skilfully wrong
