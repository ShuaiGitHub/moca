1102SCN: the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
