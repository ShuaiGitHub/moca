1419SCN: -- 
right okay <way you go>
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather well .
he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice a day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ except in the winter 
when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
great thank you very much . alright so we're finished the recording there so that went okay didn't it <mm> .
excellent and so which test have you found the hardest? .

ah again and I'm making excuses since the earthquake it seems to have gone out the window a wee bit <right yeah oh>
