1228SCN: an early happy . childhood memory . well . I think . one of the things that was very very happy . to me . was when my father said to me . 
I'll take you to Wellington . to see the exhibition - and . of course I got to the exhibition . 
and here was the laughing clowns . and the scenic railways . and the big slides called the Jack and Jill . and . er . 
it was the most wonderful day I had there . one of the er things . one of the displays that I thought was marvellous . 
was a Chinese exhibition of acrobatics . <oh right> and seeing these Chinese boys . with knives . pointing in towards each other . 
and standing back . and taking a running dive . right through . and not touching one of then . it was absolutely marvellous <>
see their girl . particularly on a tight rope . and she could walk on the tight rope . one step . after another . 
and then all of a sudden go dance dance dance dance . across it . and never fell. it was a wonderful day . and that's probably one . 
of the happy memories . of my childhood .

Interviewer 1228SCN: excellent . oh very good well thank you very much . <mmm> okay . now . can you tell me what you had for breakfast this morning . 

1228SCN: yes . I can have . I have . muesli . with porridge on the top of it . and I had . apricots . bottled apricots . freshly bottled .

1228SCN: I have actually at the moment . very much . on a regular . basis of that . but the fruit changes . I'll have a banana . 
I'll have plums . I'll have pears . but I'll still basically have . the muesli . b~ um . muesli . and the porridge . with milk .. 

Interviewer 1228SCN: excellent 

1228SCN: and coffee . 

Interviewer 1228SCN: oh very good . okay . alright so we're nearly done . are you okay?

1228SCN: mmm 

Interviewer 1228SCN: great . so now as I mentioned there's just this brief paragraph to read . so it's not a test of reading skill . 
um if you'd like to have a look through it first . otherwise when you're ready just read that aloud - - read

1228SCN:  . right I'll read - the grandfather passage - you wish to know all about my grandfather - well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - he dresses himself in an old black frock coat - usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day . he plays skillfully . and with zest . upon a small organ - except in the winter . when the cold or the ice prevents . 
 he schl~ slowly takes . a short walk . in the open air . each day - we've often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . 
but he always answers . banana oil - grandfa~ grandfather . likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer 1228SCN:  . excellent . thank you very much . alright so we're done there so that that went okay didn't it .

Interviewer 1228SCN:  so which test was the hardest then? - - 

1228SCN: oh the hardest test . was . that complicated drawing . which I . did . but didn't memorise .
