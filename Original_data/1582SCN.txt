well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . <haha> grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
