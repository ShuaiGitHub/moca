Interviewer 1040SCN: now tell me about an . early childhood memory - 

1040SCN: I can remember a snow fall . when I lived at north beach I think I must have been . about four years old .
coming home from kindergarten one morning and just . loving the sight of the falling snow <mhmm> . is that enough ? 

Interviewer 1040SCN: um . any~ anything else ?

1040SCN: well the next m~ it snowed heavily all night long . and the next morning we were rugged up and allowed to go out and play .
and I walked right into the lawn and got into the centre of the lawn . and just could not move in any direction I seemed to be fully suspended .
from the waist . down in this . snow <mm> 

Interviewer 1040SCN: was this more than . more snow than the . ninety four snow fall ? 

1040SCN: I think perhaps it was it must have been <mm> in the nineteen forty four yes it was . very deep 

Interviewer 1040SCN: so I suppose schools . cancelled for the day ?

1040SCN: I th~ I should imagine so but being four years old I can't really remember the repercussions of that <mm> I had older siblings in the school but .
obviously they were there playing with me so school was . off . 

Interviewer 1040SCN: mm thank you . um . what did you have for breakfast ?

1040SCN: breakfast today I had . the remaining two grapes on a very wizened up bunch of . 
that was in the fruit bowl and I had a banana and then I had a slice of toast . 
and . my general little ritual pot of coffee with um frothy milk in it . 

Interviewer 1040SCN: and what do you like best for breakfast ? .

1040SCN: well that seems to be the um 
what I prefer is some fuit and then just toast but I do prefer a much grainier loaf of bread which I didn't have this morning unfortunately -

Interviewer 1040SCN: okay could you please read this passage 
it's not a test of reading skills <no thank you> so you might like to look over it first just let me know when you are ready to read it aloud

1040SCN: I am now <okay> it's titled . the grandfather passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in a black f~ frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a profound feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer 1040SCN: cool we're done . it went okay didn't it ? <yes> um . so which test was the hardest ? --

oh copying was okay but later on . recalling the full diagram
