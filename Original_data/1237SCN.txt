1237SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observed him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
 . twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he also always answers banana oil - - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
