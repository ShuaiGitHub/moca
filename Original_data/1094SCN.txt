1094SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
