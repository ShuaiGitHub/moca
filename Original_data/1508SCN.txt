1508SCN: well while canoeing on the Avon river
my darling aunt who took us on wonderful expeditions as children
four children in my family .
um . was demonstrating her skill at rowing and rowed into the bank of the river
to get out of the boat on to the bank . 
and of course the boat went out as the feet were still in the boat 
and the hands were on the bank and she ended up in the water 
much to the delight of the four children - <h~>

1508SCN: went to a . primary school in the Hornby area of Christchurch -
the four children were all at the one school - 
um . happy times . we had the most wonderful swimming bath . 
that we just about lived in at the weekends -- 
um - I don't remember a lot about school other than the discipline . 
um . my brother was a prefect at the school and he was in charge of giving out the apples - 
<apples?> we had daily apples <really?> 
so he made sure that the sisters got the best ones .
and I also remember school milk . 
and with the little cardboard top on the milk bottle
and ah we had an individual bottle that I loved having my own bottle .
and we were given a straw to stick through the cardboard . 
top and we thought that was rather nice . 
and no doubt the apples and the milk kept us all healthy . 
we walked to and a half miles to school
and we were expected to go to school in all weathers - 
we walked on shingle roads . we had marvellous times with .
all the neighbour's children as we walked to school built huts in . broom paddocks . 
played hide and seek . and all together a wonderful lifestyle 

Interviewer (JW): that sounds fantastic thank you for that .

because I was in such a hurry <yeah> .

Interviewer (JW): good stuff what do you like best for breakfast? -- 

1508SCN: well if I had a choice I'd have lovely fresh fruit and y~ low fat yoghurt .

and tea .

mm . the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather -
well he is nearly ninety three years of age .
he is ninety three years old - 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat -
usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who obsor~ observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully .
and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents -
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less -
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer (JW): thank you . cool we have finished the recording . that went okay didn't it? <yes> -
so which test have you found the hardest? - 

1508SCN: subtraction --
