in UK which is in e~ Essex .

1178SCN: ok this is the one called the grandfather passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest . upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk into the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
