1001SCN: . the grandfather passage -
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons m~ missing .
a long beard clears clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small o~ organ .
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -

Interviewer 1001SCN: great that recording went ok . didn't it? -

1001SCN: yip . 

Interviewer 1001SCN: cool - ok . woops
