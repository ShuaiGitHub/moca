1467SCN: usually I like cornies and and um . yoghurt with it um 
but since I had the operation that I had I haven't been able to eat sort of harder stuff 
so I've been eating porridge which I used to hate 
and I've quite taken to it as long as I can put some brown sugar on it <yeah> sweeten it up 

Interviewer (Simon): very good . excellent all right so we're nearly finished are you okay? . cool .
right now as I mentioned we've got this paragraph for you to read through

but when you are ready to read that aloud you just go ahead -- 

1467SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses hi~ dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have urged him to walk more and smoke less but he's always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 
silly fella smoking I smoked for s~ smoked for many years and I gave it away 

Interviewer (Simon): oh right that was very good
