1591SCN: the grandfather's passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather - well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in his old black frock coat . usually with swiftly several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow . or ice prevents he slowly . takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be . modern in his language .
