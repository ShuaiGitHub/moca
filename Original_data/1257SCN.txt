well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin . given those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
