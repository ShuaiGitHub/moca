the teachers used to smoke <mhmm> and the only time I ever saw a teacher smoke while he was teaching the class <mm> 
and ah . during the war years most of the men teachers were in the war .
and ah with the result we had 
old spinsters and that they were dragged out of retirement and they were hard and they were brought up 
in really tough times so they were most of them teachers I only ever had very few men teachers .
ah but I can always remember ah getting them the dust out of the duster cos the dusters had a wooden back to them 
<yip> and boy they di~ they made a bang get in there 
you'd never get away with it today but that's the way it was <mhmm> that's one of my e~ my very early memories of school <mm>

1098SCN: I don't wa~ g~ I'll give it a go . cold . cold turkey <okay> 
the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is real~ nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with seven buttons missing 
several buttons missing sorry a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language full stop
