1026SCN: okay um -- playing rugby was an interesting experience i~ in in Taupaki had a . 
two teacher school and everyone was expected to play rugby and one -
year - a new boy arrived . w~ his mother delivered him to school and he was wearing shoes ah 
none of us at school. wore shoes and probably never had any shoes . 
so we whipped Noel's shoes off him . cos he wanted to play rugby . and made him play rugby - 
in bare feet . and because he protested we made him walk through thistles . and the next day his mother arrived at school -
fuming like um . ah a wild . bull . and we were all lined up ah and taught a lesson on how to teach . 
how to treat new boys that came with different . ideas to ours
during the war I had a . tenth~ - ah - yeah ah probably a . 
ninth . birthday and I remember the . I had the best present I had was a can of pineapple because one of the . 
neighbour's fathers had worked in Fiji and he'd . brought back a can of . pineapple which they gave me for a birthday present and I often think if .
my grandchildren got a . can of pineapple they'd be pretty . cheesed off at the moment - still a while to go?

ah old . hot water . baths where we could -- frolic and play in in . hot water but .
I happened to go back a few years ago and . I don't think the baths have changed very much from . 
sixty years ago really thy're still pretty primitive by - the standards of Hanmer or places like that .

1026SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to work~ walk more and smoke less . but he also~ always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
