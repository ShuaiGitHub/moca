1229SCN:  you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing - a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil - grandfather likes to be modern in his language
