Interviewer 1113SCN: now could I get you to tell me about an early childhood memory ? . 
-- 

1113SCN: I remember - smells - amd sounds - and vaguely -- 
sight . when I was two I was I spent quite a long time in an infirmary with a serious burn - and I remember - and I .
realise afterwards . it must have been one of the nurses looking after me - she . 
used to sing and it was probably a popular tune at the time um - sing to me gypsy . in your caravan - 
I can remember that and I can rememebr vaguely the shape . of a . young woman . or woman . but she had a woman's voice I realise that when I get older . 
and the smell . and the smell fascinated me and it's . fascinated f~ me for many years afterwards until I . remembered where I'd first encountered it . 
and I used to get -- 
f~ pr~ ah experience this odour ah and it was p~ in peroxide - and I thought perhaps later on a similar smell to formaldehyde but . 
my knowledge of . chemistry is . not wide but ah . that . smell I always associated with . that song . and the sound of a . 
a female voice singing to me <mm> ah - 

Interviewer 1113SCN: yeah that's excellent thank you very much that was great . okay

they may have used one of those two or a similar thing as a disinfectant <mm> I know it was about 
it was a wee bit earlier about um world war two time. and between the wars I'm sure they would have <yeah yeah> um 
at that it became quite a um . 
they emphasised I guess cleanliness in hospitals and things like that so 

1113SCN: it would be asscoiated with a hospital <definitely> 
atmosphere yeah

1113SCN: cos it may even have been on my bandages and so forth <yip it yes>

um -- and -- cranberry juice . <oh yum> I used to have milk but ah I usually have a fruit juice the last year or so -- 
um . and a cup of coffee . I've been trying to cut down . down on my bread intake . 
cos I thought it was affecting me um . eighteen months ago a couple of years ago and I thought it might be something in the . 
cereal the wheat germ whatever . but um . I've always been very very fond of bread and um . 
so I've tried to reduce it . so I don't have . or very seldom do I have my breakfast toast with marmalade .

1113SCN: the grandfather passage -
you wish to know all about my grandfather well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil - 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer 1113SCN: all right well thank you very much . so we're done there that went okay didn't it

1113SCN: ah yes very well thank you <excellent>

 of a monstrosity architectural monstrosity
