1266SCN: a happy childhood memory um . oh I don't know well I was brought up during the war and . 
after a bomb we used to get on our bicycles and go out and look for 
the shrapnel and I I thought that was quite fun at the time -

Interviewer 1266SCN: just tell me a little bit more about that perhaps one in particular time when you went out with somebody or a 

1266SCN: <during the war> well we . <just tell a bit of a story> we had . 
we had no petrol during the war and our car was kept in the garage up on blocks so everywhere we went on bicycles .
and we used to go and visit my grandmother who lived a long way away - 
and we always used to have to stop half way cos I was on my little bicycle with my 
legs going round and round and round rather fast . and it was really .
an amazing distance . think back that I used to cycle the way over there and all the way back 
my little sister went on the back of my . mother's bicycle - but um . yeah we bicycled big long distances - 
so I didn't really know what it was like to go in a car for a few years . 

Interviewer 1266SCN: and um when you got to your grandmother's what would you 

1266SCN: <do> oh well we'd have lunch or something then have to bicycle all the way home again - -

Interviewer 1266SCN: just a wee bit more mmm

1266SCN: oh well I'll tell you about the time I cut my leg . my the gardener gave me a plant . and my brother a plant 
which were going to be ours and we wanted to put them in the cucumber frame which is . 
like a lying down window on a box . and my brother carefully climbed up standing on the . 
gl~ on the wood frame . to put his plant in a the top which was open so I followed suit and I climbed up on the glass 
. and of course I fell in and I have still to this day a wonderful scar down my leg where I cut it right open -
and the gardener was . horrifed and went up - and my mother was . 
eight months pregnant and they were all afraid it would bring the baby on but th~ they rolled me up in a bath towel and
laid me on a bed and then the doctor came and a anesthtist came to the house - 
and I was put to sleep and stiched up . and for several weeks I wasn't allowed to walk and the baby was born and I 
felt I was being treated like another baby because I had to have a ride in the pram too

1266SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language that's a new one on me <that's right>
