1480SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a profound feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
