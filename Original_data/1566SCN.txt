out at Chaney's corner . and we had looked at . a big willow tree . and . decidedly reluctantly that it was unclimbable because the first 
branch was about twelve feet . up the trunk . and all of a sudden . a crazy cow came careering down the bank <yeah> . 
and we found ourselves sitting on the bottom branch we must have gone up that tree like a couple of cats up a fence .
yeah . but I think that was funny 

JW: yeah . that was funny .

1566SCN: I'm fine <excellent> yes . 

JW: oh . could you read this passage please . now it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first . 
and let me know when you're ready to read it aloud - 

1566SCN: I see - er . you wish to know all about my grandfather . singular . well both of them are dead . no . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

JW: thank you . I'm glad you giggled at that bit . no one else does <> I find it really funny 

1566SCN: his own small organ 

JW: I know I get the giggles every time no one else . no one else has . picked up on it or if they have they've kept it very . close to
their chest but . nice .

JW: well we have finished the recording . it went okay didn't it? .
