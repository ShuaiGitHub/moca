and found myself on the other side of the river

and heading for a weir that was out . to the ah . to the ocean --

Interviewer (Anne): could you read this passage for me? great - 

1413SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and slo~ smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer (Anne): thank you 

1413SCN: banana oil?
