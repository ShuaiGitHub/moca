yet he still thinks a~ yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
coat usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
