well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost ex~ respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest on a upon 
a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day .
we have often urged him . to walk more and smoke less
