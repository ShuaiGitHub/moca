the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him t~ to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
