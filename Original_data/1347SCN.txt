1347SCN: oh yes lots of things about from school days um when I first started school in the country a neighbouring family
um . had several children that went to the same primary school and they had a pony and 
it was called a pony a trap I think and so 
the oldest one was twelve she drove the pony and trap and picked us up and we sat along the side on the seat
and were taken to school um there was always a paddock for the horses at the at the at the school 
and that was actually a lot of fun going in po~ by in ponies to school <really> yeah <so would have>

Interviewer 1347SCN: all the horses at the school

Interviewer 1347SCN: I used to have a pony when I was younger too . ok and what did you have for breakfast this morning?

Interviewer 1347SCN:  ok um we're nearly finished are you ok . 

1347SCN: pardon 

Interviewer 1347SCN: we're nearly finished are you ok? <oh yeah that's fine actually> perfect 
um ok so I'd just like you to read this passage for me 
it's not a test of reading skills <no no> um but when you're ready you can go for it 

1347SCN:  sure - the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil.
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer 1347SCN: wee passage isn't it . ok so we're just going to . 
finish off with a few questions . um but we've finished the recording and it went ok didn't it?

1347SCN: mmm hmm

Interviewer 1347SCN: perfect so which test did you find the hardest?

1347SCN: the drawing the re~ representing the images um . I don't find
well one I don't have drawing skill might have been because I was 
forced to write with my right hand when I was first at 
school until an enlightened teacher decided I was really left handed and switched me to left handedness 
ah so that's probably my least favourite one mmm hmm

Interviewer 1347SCN: that's ok - -
