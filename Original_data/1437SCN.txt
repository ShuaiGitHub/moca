the grandfather passage -
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -

Interviewer (Anne): thank you 

1437SCN: and what's banana oil meant to be
