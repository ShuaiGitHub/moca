and we took the afternoon off and off we go biked to Waipawa

a school teacher s~ boarding at our place and I had the headmaster next door and 
I was very anti teachers at that time cos I sa~ and my sister was one too

just let me know when you're ready to read it aloud -- 

1476SCN: ah the grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
stil~ yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several bus~ buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in winter when the snow or ice p~ prevents 
he us~ slowly takes a short walk in the o~ open air every day -
we have often u~ urged him to w~ walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
