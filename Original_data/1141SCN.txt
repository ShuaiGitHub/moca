1141SCN: the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . 
he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling .
of the utmost respect .
twice each day . he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
 it's lovely <laugh> where does that come from .

Interviewer 1141SCN: um I don't know where

1141SCN: it's really rather delightful

and I'm never asked to do such things <laugh yeah> so I felt
quite inadequate there
