or even a friend when you were younger so just any kind of story - - 

1565SCN: well that's very . quite difficult because I'm not a very good raconteur and I would have to think about . 
yes that's very hard to . think of a funny story . I'm not what you might call a um bon vivant .
and ah . I . can see funny things and I but I have to be in the right mood .
to um to get them . and I'm trying to think about . funny things but I cannot recall one at the moment .
probably having giving me the given me this task I would probably be able to recall many tonight

1565SCN: a story from school well I mean you could talk about your own exploits perhaps 

Interviewer 1565SCN: mmm hmm

1565SCN: oh - yes I can . think of things . like um for example participating in boxing now I was a horrible boxer
but I wasn't afraid of getting hurt in the boxing ring . so it meant that I was a real s~ slugger
and I just used to go hammer and tongs and I . I had three fights and I lost two of them . 
both to the same - um . chap or fellow or what you like to you . 
later became a psychiatrist I don't think he was a very good psychiatrist but he became a psychiatrist 
and he was considerably shorter than me but he could beat me very easily .
admittedly he was a little older so he had probably more experience 

Interviewer 1565SCN: mmm hmm

1565SCN: mmm I don't know wheather my I don't think I damaged his managed to damage his brain at all 

Interviewer 1565SCN: oh unfortunate um and what did you have for breakfast today? .

the bread was homemade by me 

Interviewer 1565SCN: oh well done

1565SCN: yes but it had a big hole in the middle of it because it didn't quite work out as well as it should have done 
<oh ok> but it was very tasty . 

Interviewer 1565SCN: and what do you like best for breakfast? - 

1565SCN: well at the moment I seem to have lost a bit of appetite . because I'm not um 
very well but . I like um a good breakfast like . bacon eggs <mmm> sausages hash browns .
it I was doing having to do a lot of work in the day that's the sort of breakfast I would like .
but otherwise I do like cornflakes and cream . and I do like porridge with um . 
nice brown sugar . and . and cream 

Interviewer 1565SCN: mmm hmm sounds good 

1565SCN:  it is good 

Interviewer 1565SCN: um so we've nearly finished you ok?

1565SCN: yeah fine carry on <perfect> no problem with me 

Interviewer 1565SCN: ok so I'd like you to read this passage for me now it's not a test of reading .
um so . if you'd like to look through it first that would be fine and then just start reading whenever you're ready 

1565SCN: ok - - this is not - this is not written . by an English . person there was one 
phrase here which I've forgotten already but it'll I'll come across . which we would rarely say in - 
um New Zealand English anyway . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ except in the winter 
when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
father . grandfather likes to be modern in his language -

Interviewer 1565SCN: thank you . 

1565SCN: now the the the the one I was commenting one before well not probably not even not relevant 
when snow or ice prevents we would n~ we would n~ generally not say that . except in the winter 
when p~ i~ um except in the winter when um he is prevented by snow or ice 

Interviewer 1565SCN: mmm 

1565SCN: that's what we would say we'd never say . that's more American English I think <mmm> 
it's a very minor point but . I'm quite interested in that . 

Interviewer 1565SCN:  thank you alright so we're nearly <that's my>

1565SCN: opinion I don't know wheather I'm right or not
