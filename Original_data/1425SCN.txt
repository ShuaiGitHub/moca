1425SCN: -- 
the grandfather passage . 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer (Anne): thank you . alright so we've finished um the recording that went all right didn't it <mhmm> .
which test was the hardest 

1425SCN: oh . thinking of something funny that happened years ago <oh>
