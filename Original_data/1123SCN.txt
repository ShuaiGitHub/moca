you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually - usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his skin his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of . the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
except in the winter when the snow is an~ or ice prevents him h~ prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
