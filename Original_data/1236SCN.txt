he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . ug~ usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin giving . 
those who observe him a pronounced feeling of upmost respect . twice each day he plays skillfully with th~ . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
