MvO: cool . er and could you tell me something funny or amusing that happened to you or even a friend while you were growing up? .
so something from school or . from your hometown - - 

1636SCN: er something funny . 

MvO: yeah . or a~ amusing just a . a good story if you've got one . 

1636SCN: well now - - in er - oh I guess when I was around . s~ seven or eight um . the means of - transport to and from school was a pony . 

MvO:  wow 

1636SCN: and um this particular pony that er I had at the time was er . quite a um - er . a flighty sort of an animal . and er it used to . 
greatly delight in unseating me <> tipping me off and er . er . I've . I became quite er . good at er . 
I guess landing without breaking anything . <yeah> er . er er er . <> it would catch me . quite unawares sometimes just by . 
shying er . at a bit of paper blowing along the road for example <mmm hmm> or if a rabbit suddenly appeared from . er <yeah> the gorse fence . 
this jolly thing would . shy sideways and unseat me completely . um . however it had a~ a~ a saving grace . 
in that um it was ground reign trained now that means . in essence that the . the er animal is um . um - taught . not to . um . 
pull away when the reigns . er go over the . animal's head and er <oh okay> onto the ground <yeah . yeah> um - 
it therefore won't run away from the scene er er after having . bucked me off . 

MvO: right okay 

1636SCN: so it was . that that was quite handy because er I I hadn't trained it . but the um . I g~ I guess the previous owner had er . had 
instilled that discipline into it and that made it <that's lucky> er <> yes . yes . er - s~
so it was quite an adventure going to and from school I guess um . <I can imagine> because it's a little wee country school where only . um . 
twenty three pupils I think <oh wow> . in that p~ little primary school - - um - and typical of . primary schools of the day there was a 
horse paddock . 
because most of the most of the children 

MvO: wow oh so different

1636SCN: needed it no school buses and that type of thing <no > no most children would either walk to school or . er took a horse or .

MvO: yip okay <okay> . go - 

1636SCN: you wish to . know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when um . th~ the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
