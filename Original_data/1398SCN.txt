Interviewer (Simon): thank you . 
ah now could I get you to tell me about something funny or amusing that happened to you or even a friend 
when you were growing up? --
or any sort of story that sticks in your mind from childhood . 

1398SCN: um -- 
my brother um ah we lived down at the beach and my brother at Christmas time he was given a cricket bat 
for Christmas and ah this was very cherished by him
and um . one day he sent me over to the beach 
to ah set up the wickets and we didn't have any proper wickets we just um 
ah gathered sticks and . and I was having trouble with um .
putting the sticks into the hard sand .
and I thought oh I've got the perfect ah tool for this and I 
grabbed the ah cricket bat and bashed the sticks
into the ah sand with the cricket bat and then I looked at the cricket bat
and here was Eric's beautiful cricket bat ah with great holes in it dents in it and
he um when he came over and saw the cricket bat .
he grabbed it and I could see the look in his face and I started to run and 
I ran across the sand hills and back home and ah 
I managed to get home to mum before he caught me <oh dear>
yes oh <oh right>

Interviewer (Simon): does he still bring it up?

1398SCN: no um . but we've had a um . a few um incidents with my brother and um 
ah sporting things I I know um 
when I was at training college I had to learn the recorder and I was not 
good at playing the recorder and 
it was after dinner and um . ah . 
everybody else had had dinner and I was sitting at the dinner table with my recorder and music trying to practise it
and Eric came in from a rugby practice and um he was um . ah .
feeling tired and I suppose he wanted a bit of peace and here I was . ah 
twerping away on this recorder . 
and ah he told me to go somewhere else and I said I was feeling grumpy about this and um 
he . um . ah . threw my ah music 
away into the corner and um . ah . 
and um I grabbed the flowers out of the vase and threw it at him . 
and then we had a a tussle and um 
mum and dad came in and broke it up but um 
I suppose we sound . 

Interviewer (Simon): that sounds like me with my brother and sister

1398SCN: it sounds terrible for two adults to behave like that but um .

Interviewer (Simon): excellent thank you . all right so we're nearly finished there so y~ you okay? <yes> great
so as I mentioned there is this um short paragraph for you to read
ah so it's not a test of reading skill so if you wish you can read
through it first ah but when you're ready just read that aloud .

1398SCN: -- 
the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black froa~ . frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
 twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (Simon):  excellent thank you very much - 
all right so we've finished the recording there so that went okay didn't it?

1398SCN: yes 

Interviewer (Simon): ah so which test have you found the hardest? -- 

1398SCN: probably the drawing - 
yes I I feel it um . ah it wasn't up to standard with neatness I think I would have liked a ruler <yes>

Interviewer (Simon): that would have made it a wee bit easier yes excellent
