pay doctors and I had sixpence in my pocket . and I gave him the sixpence . and he took it very seriously and said

1577SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest . upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
