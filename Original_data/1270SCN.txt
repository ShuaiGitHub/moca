1270SCN:  the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling 
 of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest . upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each w~ day . we have often urged him to walk more 
 and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - -
