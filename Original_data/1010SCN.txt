Interviewer 1010SCN: all right thank you . right so this is participant number one zero one zero S C N the date is the sixteenth of August two thousand and ten - okay .
could you please now count to ten . 

1010SCN: one two three four five six seven eight nine ten <cool> - 

Interviewer 1010SCN: thank you . all right could you now tell me about an early childhood memory - just anything that comes to mind .

1010SCN: um . I walked to work . not s~ work I worked~ I walked to school . 
when I was . seven . and . the . pavements .
were something that took my attention . because of . the way . it . cracked at driveways and things like that <mm> . 
and I would often be . halfway to school before I even realised where I was .

Interviewer 1010SCN: so you kinda got your head down just following it all the way <yeah>

1010SCN: th~ w~ no no sideroads <oh right> <excellent> 

Interviewer 1010SCN: so um what school did you go to? 

1010SCN: Addington school 

Interviewer 1010SCN: Addington? oh right . that's cool . so um . so you remember kinda anything else from the age of seven that happened? --

1010SCN: I think when I was six I won a printing competition at school if I didn't win it I got second . 
I have an idea the prize might have been a whole shilling 

Interviewer 1010SCN: oh right that's a lot for a six year old in those days <possibly> 

1010SCN: certainly ah four or five icecreams anyway <oh excellent> - mm
I had three . sisters . who were all younger than me . 
so I can have early memories of them . playing in the driveway .
on red tricycles . and of course one of those tricycles would have been mine at some stage 
but I was now too big to ride the tricycle . <oh I see> but you just . 
I mean I don't think I weas jealous of the fact they had it I just can remember them riding it 

Interviewer 1010SCN: th~ they're younger siblings were they?

1010SCN: yeah they're all younger <cool> 

Interviewer 1010SCN: right ah what did you have for breakfast this morning? . 

1010SCN: I started with porridge . and I had two slices of toast with marmalade on them . <oh yum> 
and a cup of tea .

Interviewer 1010SCN: oh excellent . and what do you like best for breakfast? .

1010SCN: best for breakfast is . 
a cereal containing . a number of grains but not quite . 
full muesli so I tend to mix it . and then I like to have a fruit . 
normally . either . peaches or stewed rhubarb with some cream and yoghurt . 
and milk so it takes about me a~about three trips to the fridge . before I've got that ready to go

Interviewer 1010SCN: excellent . very good -
okay so w~ we're nearly finished . so everything all right <yeah> going okay? <fine> cool - 
now . could you please read this passage for me. 
so it's not a test of reading skill at all so yo~ take your time if you want to read through it a few times to yourself <okay> first and then <well the>

1010SCN: first thing on the page is sixteen then . the grandfather passage . 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black fro~ frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern . in his language 

Interviewer 1010SCN: excellent . thank you very much .
all right so that's it we're all done <okay> . 
all right so that last bit that went okay didn't it <I think so> cool .
um which test <I think>

1010SCN: I think reading that for me was a wee bit difficult . <okay>
I don't know if you noticed I kept leaning forward a wee bit because of the bifocals <oh right> 
<oh okay> I couldn't quite get the words . 
ah to start with . I sort of improved as I got down the page w~ when they were at the top they were a bit far away from me <mm> so just a . 
a glasses thing I think I should have probably picked the page up and brought it closer to me . yeah <that's cool excellent>

Interviewer 1010SCN: um were any t~ any of those tests that you found the hardest? -

1010SCN: um . I was s~ surprised how difficult the five words were . 
like faith velvet something . something and red <yes yeah yip> I was surprised how difficult that was . 

Third speaker: All done <yip> oh good . what did you think
