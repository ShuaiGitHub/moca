it had a little cabin in it and Wendy's father was standing in the back 
like this and every now and again 
oh water would and he was just hating the whole thing and the n~ his friend was driving the boat anyway we
it was terrifying we all honestly thought we were going to get drowned

 you wish to know all about my grandfather? . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons . 
 missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully with and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents   he
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 
sweet little story
