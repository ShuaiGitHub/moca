usually with several buttons missing . 
a~ a long beard clings to his chin giving him . who observe him a pronounced feeling 
of the utmost imnporta~ utmost respect . 
twice each day he playfully skills and with zest upon a small organ except in the winter 
when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
