so it's not a test of reading skill so if you do want to look through it first that's fine but when you are ready you can just read that aloud . 

1439SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer (Simon):  excellent thank you 
okay so that's the recording part done there . that went okay didn't it <yeah> cool
ah so which test have you found the hardest? .

1439SCN: --
