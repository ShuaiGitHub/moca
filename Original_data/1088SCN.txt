Interviewer 1088SCN: k . now can you tell me about an early childhood memory ? 

1088SCN: well I did have a very . nasty accident I put my foot in the wheel of my mother's bike <oo> when I was about four and . 
yes that's very vivid in my mind um . it tore the sort of side off my foot I still have the scar <oh> 
and um yes it . it involved me I didn't have crutches I don't know whether they didn't given them to you . when you were four but 

Interviewer 1088SCN: I've never seen a four year old with crutches actually <no> 

1088SCN: well that's right so I had to crawl everywhere you know <oh> so yes that was . that's a very vivid . childhood experience <I can> 

Interviewer 1088SCN: I can imagine <yes> so what did you have for breakfast 

1088SCN: I had muesli . I~ and yoghurt . banana and peaches . 

Interviewer 1088SCN: that's nice and what do you like best for breakfast ? 

1088SCN: that oh well always always muesli and banana um sometimes kiwifruit or . something else but always those <yeah> I don't <so you had>

Interviewer 1088SCN: your ideal breakfast

1088SCN:  yeah I did that's what I have every morning and I love it 

Interviewer 1088SCN: yeah it's a nice start to your day <yes> okay so we're nearly finished <yes> are you okay ? 

1088SCN: yes I'm fine yeah 

Interviewer 1088SCN: so could you read this passage please . 
it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first <mhmm> let me know when you are ready to read it out aloud --

1088SCN: yes I can read that all right <okay> mhmm
 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swis~ fly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old frock black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the s~ open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to pla~ to walk more and smoke less but he always says - 
 banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer 1088SCN: it's very strange passage isn't it <mm> 

1088SCN: I said says instead of answers but anyway that's okay if I'm reading to my grandchildren I often say that . you just the same 

Interviewer 1088SCN: okay so we're done that went okay didn't it 

1088SCN: yes <yip> yeah it was great 

Interviewer 1088SCN: so which test was the hardest ? -

1088SCN: um . probably redrawing the complex drawing I would say <mm> um . because I didn't . well
you do commit certain parts of it to memory <yeah> but I didn't .
because I didn't really know that I was going to I sort of probably might have looked at it more but yes I would say . probably doing that 
and those five word things <oh> after you'd done the yeah . everything
