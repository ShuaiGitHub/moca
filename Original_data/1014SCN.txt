1014SCN: the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in . an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard . clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
 twice each day he plays skilfully - and with zest - upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer 1014SCN: brilliant . 
so we're done um . that went okay didn't it - 
so which test was the hardest?

Interviewer 1014SCN: that stupid spaceship that you made me that you didn't tell me that I had to remember it everyone always says that 
that that complicated figure thing that's always that's always the hardest
