 well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents he ta~ slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil grandfather likes to be modern in his language --
