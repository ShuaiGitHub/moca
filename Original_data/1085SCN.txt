okay - 
the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

so that went okay didn't it
