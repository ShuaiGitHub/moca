1121SCN: okay - <yip> . shall I go <yes go for it> 
the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock cl~ coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -- <thank you>
