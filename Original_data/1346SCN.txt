it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first um 
let me know when you're ready and you can just read it out loud - - 

1346SCN:  right . you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in an the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
