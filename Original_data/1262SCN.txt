helping with the shearing . and ah . herding cows riding round the paddock on a . 
harrow to break up the clods before he . planted winter crop for the sheep . 
and I used to do all their rabbit trapping I probably trapped - ah .
three to five hundred rabbits a day . and um . we.
put them all in a pile neighbour came over with a bulldozer at the weekend and buried them . 
and um . I I learnt a lot about farms and people and . sheep . 
and ah I learnt to hang onto a horse if the horse decides to stick his head in the tro~ in the pond <mmm>
 I dived smartly over his head into the pond wasn't very pleased about that at all .

1262SCN:  - - the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer 1262SCN: alright well we're done .
