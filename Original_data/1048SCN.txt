1048SCN: . the grandfather passage 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him 
 a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 
 . banana oil 
I've never heard that one
