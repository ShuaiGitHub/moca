1307SCN:  you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
