1031SCN: oh my old man used to wake me up about six o clock in the morning and say come on Jack you got your work to do down in the glasshouses - 
so I had to go down and work in the glasshouses from that age . onwards and then ah . eventually I'd get to school <mm> --
I remember one time . going to school -- B~ Beckenham school I went to . and they have some ponds in front of Beckenham school - 
and they'd b~ the~ they'd been very m~ messy around the side - 
and the caretaker or somebody had cleaned them up and I went very close to the edge - of the pool and slipped in and finished up - 
doing a thorough ducking in the pool . I had to go home and ch~ and change . and then s~ . 
another day I um we were going - into school and saw a whole lot of bees on the middle of the l~ l~ - c~ b~ park 
so I picked up a clod of soil and I chucked it at the bees . I've never run so fast in my life after that --
bu~ bu~ but I~ my father - 
wouldn't allow me to go to school without s~ shoes on or boots - so I w~ I was a - 
I was known as a clodhopper because I had big boots big heavy shoes on -
and when I played cricket . I couldn't . I wasn't very good at cricket but - 
I was always . I always bought myself a s~ a . a um . a bat by taking having a big apple to the s~ school and 
the~ a big app~ they're called . ever heard of them? . great big apples like this <mm> and ah
I'd take it to school and I'd give it give it to you and you'd give me a bat and I'd have ah . <mm> three hits I suppose and then so that was me .
 my limitations as f~ as far as cricket's concerned <mm> -

yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in his old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who des~ observe him a pronounced feeling o~ of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the wintertime winter when s~ the snow or ice pre~ prevents he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day . .
we often urge him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be . modern with his language -
