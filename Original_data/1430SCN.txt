1430SCN: funny or amusing um - um -- 
oh yes -- 
I'd learnt to water ski . and . 
I hadn't been doing it very much . but I could water ski okay . 
but then I was with a girlfriend and her parents at their bach - 
and someone had water skis so I was having a go . and - 
probably I was . I think I was showing off a bit I suppose 
cos the boat was going along parallel to the shore
it was just not a beach it was a stony . stony sort of beach - 
 and . I thought I'd do one of these cool dismounts 
where you swing out and let go of the rope and go into the into the beach
but what I didn't realise was . that . as you -
pulled away from the back of the boat in an arc your speed actually increased - .
so I was actually instead of slowing down .
well I hit the shore I was actually still going quite fast 
the skis stopped but I didn't - <ow> I wa~
that's all right I didn't hurt myself too much I just did a somersault through the air but .
um . set a good impression anyway it was just a good laugh for everyone -

1430SCN: the grandfather passage 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .   twice
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (Anne): thank you <banana oil?> exactly . 
we've finished the recording that went okay didn't it? <yip> 
um so which um test did you find the hardest? . 

1430SCN: um . drawing that . diagram from memory <mm>
