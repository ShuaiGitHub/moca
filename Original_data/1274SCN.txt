 he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an long black frock coat usually with several bu~ buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we've often urged him to walk more and to smoke less but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
