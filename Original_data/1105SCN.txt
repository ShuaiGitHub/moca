<yes> oh ah a minute <yes> sorry or something crazy like that but mmm <right> 
pays to be alert <yes> ok 

1105SCN: <thank you> well you can be thinking about something too . 
when you're driving along <mmm> and y~ your brain . is suddenly
fr~ a~ s~ split second just . switches off <mmm>
<yeah> and you're just not aware of what's infront of you <yeah> 
so um . you know if you drive with ah . your shoes off that doesn't usually happen .
<mmm> got cold feet <yeah> 

Interviewer 1105SCN: yeah that's true I always drive with my shoes off cos I feel um . I don't feel I have a .
as much control with the shoes <yeah> on cos there's that bit in between my

1105SCN:  f~ y~ sole of your shoe . yeah th~ they say that if you 

Interviewer 1105SCN: foot and the so I to have my foot on there to sense it 

1105SCN: if you um go for a long trip <mmm> drive 
without your shoes on <yeah> your feet'll get very cold <yeah>

alert <yeah> because your feet are cold 

Interviewer 1105SCN: that's the same thing with um . yeah older people when they start having falls

Interviewer 1105SCN: is um

is um read this passage aloud um so it's not a test of reading skills <no>
feel free to have a good read of it <yeah> to get familiar with it 
and whenever you're ready just just start reading - - 

1105SCN: ok - you wish to know about your grandfather well .
he is nearly ninety years old yet he still thinks .
as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself .
in an . black . coat . frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling . of the utmost respect .
twice a day he plays skilfully with his . zest upon .
a small organ . except in the winter time when the snow .
or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but his . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather like to be modern in his language

Interviewer 1105SCN: <laugh> it's adorable isn't it 
ok so we're done 

1105SCN: oh right 

Interviewer 1105SCN: it went ok didn't it 

1105SCN: yeah it did <oh good> very good 

Interviewer 1105SCN: excellent . so which test was the hardest -

1105SCN: um - I don't really know 

Interviewer 1105SCN: yeah oh that's good you must have d~ found them all good 

1105SCN: <laugh> well yeah I th~ th~ the one with the memory of the um .
the things and I I missed one out <oh oh yeah> daisy . um <yeah> .
I - I'm not very good at remembering numbers and ah s~ .
things like that because . I'm a slightly dyslexic

Interviewer 1105SCN: oh ok yeah

1105SCN: and when I worked f~ worked f~ um . 
with New Zealand Post I was spose to remember a lot of different numbers <ah> and 
things like that so I chose 

Interviewer 1105SCN:  ah 

1105SCN: not to <yeah> because I thought at
the end of the day if I was spose to remember something and I get them
round the wrong way <oh yeah> it's going to come back and bite me one <yeah yeah>
so <laugh> I chose it's like ah telephone numbers <ah yeah> . 
I choose choose not to remember them 
<yeah> um . I can look them up . <yeah> and put them in the telephone if I want to <yeah>
<yeah> and that's the was I do it 

Interviewer 1105SCN: I'm the same <yes> I'm not um . unbelieveably um . even though I'm an engineer 
my arithmetic is terrible <yeah> so um . r~ ah cos I have no short
I'm not very good with 
short term remembering numbers so I can't <no m~> hold two numbers in my head 
<yeah> and add two number to them <yeah> um cos . 
my memory's and the same with telephone numbers <yes> I can't hold it in my head

1105SCN: no I can't either <mmm> 
and I just I I I've ch~ I spose I could learn to do it . <yeah> 
but I choose not to because if somebady says to me what's such and such phone number 
and I give it the wrong way round <laugh> then I'm going to be in trouble
<laugh> you gave me the wrong number so I'd rather not 
<yeah> I'd rather look it <rather> up 
yeah yeah yeah 

Interviewer 1105SCN: rely on it well that's good you know
