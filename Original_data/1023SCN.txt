a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a . short walk in the open air each day -

banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
