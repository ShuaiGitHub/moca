at the same level . and I found that intermediate did gave me that opportunity 
and they had . they had sewing and metal work and . cooking and um
I took to it in those in those years . so that's where I probably found it

you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
the long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a profound feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with . zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers . banana oil .
fa~ grandfather likes to be modern in his language what a chap
