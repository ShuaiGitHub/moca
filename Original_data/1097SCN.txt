which was no trouble and I had to change clothes and I went back to school . 
in the afternoon barefooted <ah>

Interviewer 1097SCN: so the last thing is oh here it is . I'd like you to read this passage <aloud> 
so it's um yeah it's not a test of reading skill so feel free to read through it and get familiar with it 
and then whenever you are ready just just start speaking and it will be recorded 

1097SCN: oh I knew you wanted to know about my grandfather - 
--  
 you wish to know all about my grandfather well . he's nearly ninety three years old - 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the ice or th~ snow or the ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we've have urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language isn't that gorgeous 

Interviewer 1097SCN:  always makes me laugh

1097SCN: that's beautiful 

Interviewer 1097SCN: yeah it's quite cute so we're done 

1097SCN: we're finished

Interviewer 1097SCN: it went okay didn't it ? 

1097SCN: yes thank you it's not nearly as terrifying as I thought it was going to be <I know> I thought it would be 

Interviewer 1097SCN: so which test was the hardest ? 

1097SCN: um remembering those five words again <oh yip> 

Interviewer 1097SCN: yip that's often the one 

1097SCN: I didn't like that .

kids game when you put a tray of things in front of you <oh yes> and you'd remember them and

Interviewer 1097SCN: have to remember them <yip>
