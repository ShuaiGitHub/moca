we had to pitch a tent . some slept in their little van . 
and we had a really lovely chirstmas . 
and one cousin who came from a family that it was f~ fairly well off

Interviewer 1164SCN: are ready you can read that aloud

1164SCN:  ah . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the air in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language <all laugh> 

Interviewer 1164SCN: excellent thank you very much 

1164SCN: my grandfather smoked til the day he died <by: mmm> and I think he stared at ten and he he
<by: laugh> died at ninety five <all laugh>
