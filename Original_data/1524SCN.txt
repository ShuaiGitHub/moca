1524SCN: <whole thing> you wish to know all about my grandfather well 
he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat scuse me
usually with several buttons missing a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect -
to each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more
and smoke less but he's always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language . yeah
