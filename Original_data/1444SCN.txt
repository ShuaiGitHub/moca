you wish to know ab~ all about my grandfather . 
well he's nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him 
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter -
when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often . urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
