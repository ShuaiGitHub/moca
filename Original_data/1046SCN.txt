1046SCN: very enjoyable 

Interviewer 1046SCN: oh good I'm so glad to hear that . 
so um th~ . basically the last thing we need to do is I'll get you to read this 
passage so it's not a test of reading skills so <no no no> take your time reading it 
<yes> and what ever and when ever you are ready just start reading it aloud 
so this is the standard <ok> they give to read 

1046SCN: right . the grandfather passage. you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ. 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer 1046SCN: it's funny isn't it 

1046SCN: yeah that's that's good 

Interviewer 1046SCN: ok so we're done

1046SCN: I've had a gr~ oh I'll come back again 

Interviewer 1046SCN: good so it went ok didn't it 

1046SCN: it's gone really well well last night I dreamt I was infront of this panel of three <oh no>
and they were saying who's the a~ the um president or prime minister <laughs> of Israel
and I'm saying oh . Netanyahu and then I'm trying to remember all these other 
questions I had fired at me <oh no> it was terrible

1046SCN: which test was the hardest um . drawing that thing from memory

Interviewer 1046SCN: ah yes

1046SCN: was the hardest for me an~ and 

Interviewer 1046SCN: that's what they all say 

1046SCN: . um that one but even harder than that was trying to think of words beginning with f
<mmm> I think because I was disappointed with myself because I can't do maths 
maths things but I do have skills with words <yeah yeah> 
and I'm . reaching to try and get them <and th~ > and since then I've thought of many 

Interviewer 1046SCN: yeah I know I know and then you do and the whole rest of the day you thinking

1046SCN: ah all those words and all these an~ I could have just trotted them out 

Interviewer 1046SCN: ah just all these f f words everywhere 

1046SCN: but that's the nature of 

Interviewer 1046SCN: yeah and that's the nature of the test <things yeah> 
and it's it's it's testing language but it's not just testing language it's testing 
how you can pull things out of 

1046SCN: yes yes absolutely 

Interviewer 1046SCN: noth~ nowhere um so it isn't
necessarily a reflection of 

1046SCN: oh no no no
