um now it's not a test of reading skills so feel free to um get familiar with the language

and um the recorder will record it .

1108SCN: I'll just do it now .

Interviewer 1108SCN: sure <mmm> go ahead .

1108SCN: the grandfather passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he's nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long b~ b~ beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -

Interviewer 1108SCN: great ok - ok so we're done
