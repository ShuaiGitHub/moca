1614SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
