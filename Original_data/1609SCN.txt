1609SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather - well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing - 
a long beard . clings to his chin . giving those . who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ - 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather . likes to be modern . in his language .
