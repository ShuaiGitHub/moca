loose in these pens and caught rats and when we arrived they had the rats tied up on the fence and ah oh some of them took a photo

1409SCN: yip I'm ready <mhmm> . the grandfather passage .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black fro~ frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we ofte~ we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 father likes to b~ grandfather likes to be modern in his language
