1100SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather - well he is nearly ninety three years old -
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -- 
he dresses himself in an old black . f~ frock coat - usually with . several buttons . missing - 
a long beard clings to his chin - giving those who . observe him -
a pronounced feeling . of the um~ utmost respect --
twice each day he plays . skilfully and . with zest upon a small organ --
except in the winter . when the snow - or ice prevents --
he slowly takes a short . walk in the . open air . each day .
we have often urged him to walk - more and more . more and smoke less .
but he always answers - - banana oil . grandfather likes to be . modern in his language -
