1166SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he's nearly ninety n~ three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language --
