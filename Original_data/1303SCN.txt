 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several butto~ buttons missing . 
 a long . long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving . those who observe . him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice a day he plays skilfully and with a zest upon a small organ . 
 except in winter . when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a s~ short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have . often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil .
