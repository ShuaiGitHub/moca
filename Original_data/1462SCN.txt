 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swis~ swiftly as ever .
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the m~ utmost respect . 
 twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to wo~ walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers banana oil 
grana~ grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
