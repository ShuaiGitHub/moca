now what I'd like you to do is read this passage here please - 
it;s not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first .
let me know when you're ready and then you can read it out loud -

1304SCN: yeah . right I haven't read it at all but I f~ ah . 
just go ahead when you're ready <yeah> -
 the grandfather passage . I wish to know all about my grandfather well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long . beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who . observe him a pronounced feeling of the . utmost respect 
 twice each day he . playfully . plays skilfully with a zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a . 
 a short walk in the open air each day . we often urge him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 
thank you .
