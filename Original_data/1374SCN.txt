<um yeah that should be alright> that'd be alright
well I had a dog called Taddy he was a rough coat jack russell 
and he always kept running away because he wasn't neutered and I didn't 
want to neuter him because he'd sired some very nice puppies 
anyway one day he ran away and he usually used to run away and
get his feet under the table at a hotel or in some kitchen where they fed him up 
furiously and brought him home anyway
this day he ran away and ah I c~ I couldn't find him
so I went to bed at night and there's a phone call about um 
nine o'clock and a man's voice said 'I've found this dog ah which belongs to you
in Riccarton bla bla bla' and I said 'thank you very much' and he said oh 'I'll bring it round' 
so i~ the truck comes around and it's the dog um 
control officer and I go out in my dressing gown and he says 
'you went to bed without reporting your dog missing' and I said 'oh he's always running away
he's not neutered' 'you better get him neutered
or otherwise if I see him so much as two feet out side your gate 
I'll put him in the pound and you'll have to pay three hundred dollars to get him back' .
so after that he had to stay behind the fences and the gates but as I say he he 
sniff the air and he was gone .

 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a  pronounced
 pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice  twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
prevents   he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
