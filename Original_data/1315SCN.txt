yet he thinks as swiftly as ever - he dresses himself in . an old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons mi~ missing - a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him 
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
