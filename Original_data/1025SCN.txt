and I don't know what happened 
where I went what I did but I ended up halfway to Bluff which is quite some miles away <it is> if you know Invercargill <definitely is>
and of course there wouldn't have been the traffic on the road then <mm> 
but my . next memory and I think a lot of it is perhaps what . I've remembered people have told me <mm> but I do remember
going into this house . into a long dark corridor and it was pretty much late afternoon by then cos with little legs on a tricycle 
and the people gave me a little bar of Nestle chocolate in its red packet and a green apple . 
and of course rang the police and my parents ha~ had been been in touch with the police anyway <mm> and they came and took me home in a police car

1025SCN:  no I can read it <okay> 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil - 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
 what a dear old boy <I know> 

Interviewer 1025SCN: okay so that's it we're at the end of the testing <good> um everything went okay didn't it
