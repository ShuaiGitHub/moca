 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect
twice .   each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
