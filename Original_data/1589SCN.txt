he dresses himself in an old . black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . a long beard hangs to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling . of utmost respect . twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged h~ often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes . to be modern in his language . dear me . never heard about banana oil <no> .
