1036SCN: the grandfather passage - 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
