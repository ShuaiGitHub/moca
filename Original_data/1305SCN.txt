1305SCN: you wish to know al~ the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
