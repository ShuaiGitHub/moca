 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him 
 a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . twice a day he plays skilfully 
 skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
