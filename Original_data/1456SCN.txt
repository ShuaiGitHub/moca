1456SCN: one two three four . five six seven eight . nine ten -

Interviewer (SL): ah now could you tell me something funny or amusing that happened to you when you were growing up? . 

1456SCN: -- 
um . how long have I got 
just go and we'll see where we'll see where it takes us
well we were playinmg Robin Hood and I was Robin Hood I'd be about . nine <mhmm> . 
and of course I was in charge <mm> and . there were two groups . 
if you were not in the merry women . 
then when we caught you we turned you into a merry woman to see 
how many of us could be on the Robin Hood's side 
I had a friend called Maid Marian and she helped
so we did a lot of chasing anyway I went home for lunch and when I came back . 
oh . i~ if we caught you we took you into the bird house and we hanged you 
<right> there was a rope from the ceiling and you put the rope around your waist <yip> 
this isn't very funny it's sad 
and ah we were hanged and then that was your initiation into the team 
I went home for lunch and when I came back they grabbed me 
took me into the bird house . 
they put the rope round my neck . 
somebody had learned how to make a knot - 
and they ran off 
and kicked the box away and I was left hanging 
I'm sorry it's not funny is it it wouldn't be today 
two big girls rushed into the birdhouse where the basketballs and all those things were put 
and found me hanging so one picked me up evidently I was going 
I was going blue and they got me down and they sent me home 
now that's the sad part <mhmm> 
but the funny part was Monday morning oh well 
when I came back to school I think I was away for about a week 
with these blue marks around my neck 
and mum didn't create a fuss or anything I mean yeah 
anyway we were all lined up in front of Sister 
and she was telling everybody off . and I laughed . <mm> 
and she said what were you doing while they were hanging you?
so I got into trouble too which I thought now is very funny 

Interviewer (SL): unfortunate really . oh wow

1456SCN: I know I don't know why that one sprang to mind but ah . yeah 
we knew and then they pulled down the bird house <mm> never happened again <mm> 

Interviewer (SL): dangerous . okay thank you . ah what did you have for breakfast? 

1456SCN: this morning <mhmm> I had a little bit of cereal which was one of those 
ah um red red tick um Hubbards ones and a banana and . 
a cup of coffee <mm> -

Interviewer (SL): ah what do you like best for breakfast? -

1456SCN: I vary . but mainly I have toast - flora . and marmalade or banana or marmite or vegemite

Interviewer (SL): thank you . okay so we've nearly finished ah are you okay? 

1456SCN: I'm fine <mm good> 
I'm quite enjoying it actually 
<oh that's good> now the drawing's over 

Interviewer (SL): okay . so . could you read this passage please 
ah it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first <yip>

1456SCN: my um I never knew my grandfather cos they lived in Ireland . 
that's why I thought it was an unusual choice because 
I didn't know grandmothers grandfathers cousins uncles aunts anybody 
<oh right> cos mum and dad came out they met in Sunderdon and they married here 
so we didn't know our relations till dad took my sister and me back in nineteen . 
eighty two I hadn't met any relations until then except my brother and my sister <mm>
but anyway 

Interviewer (SL): so we've written it for you . 
so just let me know when you are ready to read it aloud .

1456SCN: -- --  
okay . the grandfather passage . all right? <mhmm>
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more 
and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -

Interviewer (SL): thank you . okay so we've finished the recording ah it went well didn't it 

1456SCN: yeah fine <okay> 

Interviewer (SL): ah which test did you find the hardest? 

1456SCN: the drawing of the kite 

Interviewer (SL): mm the complex the complex
