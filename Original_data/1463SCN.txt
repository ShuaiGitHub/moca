 usually with some bu~ with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he pain he~ plays skilfully - 
 and with z~ zest upon a small organ 
 except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents -- 
 he s~ slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers . banana oil . 
 grandfather . likes to be modern in his language --
