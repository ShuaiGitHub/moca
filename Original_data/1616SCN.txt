<mmm> everybody had their . friends and there were little cliques . and I felt quite strange <mmm> . not . I had a different school system . 
I sat the um . the Cambridge school certificate where people here hadn't done that <mmm> - so . I seem to have had adjustments right through my

so they would leave my siblings in Scotland to go to highschool . which they did . leaving them in nineteen thirtynine . <mmm>
taking me back to Kenya . and then the war broke out . <mmm> and they didn't see those other three kids for eight years

1616SCN: the grandfather passage - you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . - 
a long beard . excuse me - clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day . he plays skillfully and with zest . upon a small organ - 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day - 
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil - grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
 what a ridiculous passage . banana oil . <um>
