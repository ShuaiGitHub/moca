he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .

a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with a zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day .
