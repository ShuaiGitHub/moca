she didn't always s~ ah stay with us where she lived was was about a mile away and 
a~ and by the time she finished helping and that at the end of the day 
I'd go with her I'd walk with her in the dark 
and about a mile to her home where sh~ and stay with her and I stayed with her quite a bit 
and I do remember that
that something happened with me she was a dear old soul and we had a lot of . 
fun with her over the years really and ah that's a good memory that I have of my childhood .
I wasn't very old at that stage - 
but ah yes she came and stayed with us in Christchurch ah /
when we lived here in early days but she's dead now of course - so - 
w~ we were a mixed lot she was ah - ah my um . mother's mother -

Interviewer 1203SCN: excellent oh well thank you <okay> um now what did you have for breakfast this morning ? 

1203SCN: what did I have for breakfast well firstly I had a banana with . ah yoghurt .

and ah and a cuppa tea - <excellent> . 

Interviewer 1203SCN: and what do you like best for breakfast . 

1203SCN: ah well I must like what I've just mentioned because I've ah 
been doing that for quite a number of years since I started to learn to cook a wee bit 
round the place 

Interviewer 1203SCN: all right yes I get that a lot evryone says that's their favourite that's great thank you .
all right so we're nearly finished . are you okay ? . <yip> cool 
now I mentioned um the passage . 
this short paragraph for you to read here <oh yes> 
um so it's not a test of reading skill so if you'd like to read through it first that's fine
but when you're ready you can just read that aloud 

1203SCN: no that's all right it's the ah grandfather passage 
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer 1203SCN: excellent thank you . all right so we're done there . so that went okay didn't it 

1203SCN: ye~ y~ yes that was fine no worries at all . 

Interviewer 1203SCN: so ah which test was the hardest ? . 

1203SCN: which test ? . oh I think that drawing drawing that figure 
thing yeah I think that was probably the one I remember mostly anyway
