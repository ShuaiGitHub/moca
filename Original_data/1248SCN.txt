he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the upmost respect . twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
