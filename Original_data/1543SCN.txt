 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice  twice each day he plays sk~ skilfully with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk 
walk   in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less
