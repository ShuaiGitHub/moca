1563SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced 
feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly wal~ takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
