two o'clock bus and we hadn't quite finished . well we we saw the bus stop . and my mother getting out that so we quickly rushed 
with the toffee which is half made . went out the back . and put it on the . because out tank stand had a . 
bit that protruded there so we dashed around . put the thing on there . and my mother came back . came up er and she went .

1595SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three . years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skillfully . and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
