: - 

1427SCN: oh wow well I have had many humourous ah incidents . but I'm thinking of when I was a student nurse . 
and this is really rather rude but however since we're living in 
two thousand and eleven I think I can tell you I was learning how to catheterise female patients . 
and um . the very first one I did unattended on my own . 
I got into the wrong hole .
and the patient was delightful we had such a laugh .
and actually when she went back to Salisbury where I lived at the time 
she'd asked me my phone number my mother's home phone number .
and she phoned and told my mother and they had a very good laugh .
so that was probably quite awful but funny to me . funny when I think back 

Interviewer (Anne): yes oh very much so thank you . um ah what did you have for breakfast? . 

1427SCN: I had axplate of muesli with um dried fruit and yoghurt . 

Interviewer (Anne): great um what do you like best for breakfast? . 

1427SCN: that's what I like best . 

Interviewer (Anne): great we're nearly finished are you okay?

1427SCN: fine fine standing up well --
kay . here's a um a passage that I'd like you to read please 
it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to have a look at it first 
just let me know when you are ready to read it out loud -- kay? . 
the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
and a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer (Anne): thank you . 

1427SCN: strange . prose
