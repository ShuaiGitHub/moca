TRANSCRIPT

Interviewer (SL): okay . so this is Siobhan Lochey with participant number one three nine five S C N on the eighth of the seventh two thousand and eleven - 
ah could you please count to ten 

1395SCN: one two three four five six seven eight nine ten -

Interviewer (SL): ah now tell me something funny or amusing that happened to you when you were growing up - - 
when you were at primary school maybe . or . just a story from primary school -

1395SCN: one of the things I remember about primary school wasn't a funny story <mhmm> but there was .
one child b~ ah my mother always used to give me fruit in my lunch . and she always w~ whenever I had an apple
I've always been very bad at eating apples I like to cut them and take the core out because otherwise I waste too much . 
but when I was at school I didn't do that of course I'd just eat the apple and there was always a lot of 
apple left on the core and there was another little girl who used to come and sit next to me <mhmm> everyday when I had an apple 
and she would eat the apple core <mm> because she never had fruit in her lunch 
that's something I can remember <mm> but it's not a funny story 

Interviewer (SL): no no it's not . um . do you think school was different . um when you were growing up than it is today? 

1395SCN: I think it probably was a bit different <mhmm> . um I don't really know what it's like in a primary school classroom now
<mm> but my gradchildren seem to be ah enjoying it anyway <mm>

Interviewer (SL): mm . yeah . do you think we . like they study different things - 
I think they do a lot more . ah . they talk a lot more and learn a lot more about the things that are going on around them . 
than we did we were very much focussed on reading writing and arithmetic and . 
and I don't recall ever talking about things like conservation and . um --
the world <mm> and not very much about nature . 
I don't remember that I do remember we did have a little bit about a little bit of nature study and I remember 
a guy coming and telling us the difference between blackbirds and starlings I can still remember that and um . 
so that's interesting but I don't rem~ even though I'm very keen on birds 
<mm> I don't remember anything else about learning about birds at school but I do remember that <mm> -
so that's a positive change you . do you think . 

1395SCN: I think so because I mean the world is the climate is changing the planet is changing and kids are going to have to be prepared for a comp~ a 
quite a different life from what . we have even now . but I grew up I think in a in a time we were 
people my of age are very lucky to grow up in the 
sixties and seventies it's just quite different now for for people in you know teenagers you know in those years . 
we didn't have all the things that the kids have today <mm> like ph~ cell phones and computers and all those things <mm> it was different <mm> -- 

Interviewer (SL): definitely . thank you -- 
ah . what did you have for breakfast? 

1395SCN: today I had toast <mhmm> which is unusual <mm> well I usually have muesli . or fu~ cereal . 
but today I just thought I'd have a change and I had toast with . vegemite and home made marmalade not on the same piece but 

Interviewer (SL): ah so what do you like best for breakfast? 

1395SCN: I think I enjoy cereal the best <mhmm> really . 
but I've always . always used to have toast I often used to have both <mm> but now I just have one or the other 
cereal's the quickest when you're going to work <it's true> -- 

Interviewer (SL): okay . so we've nearly finished ah are you okay? 

1395SCN: yeah I'm fine <mhmm good>

Interviewer (SL): -- 
so could you read this passage please . it is not a test of reading skill so you might want to have a look at it first <it's okay> 
ah let me know when you're ready to read it aloud 

1395SCN: oh I can just read it that's fine <okay go> 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (SL): mm . thank you . okay so we've finished the recording it went well didn't it?

1395SCN: it did mhmm . 

Interviewer (SL): ah which test did you find the hardest?
oh remembering the . drawing of the the complex lines and crosses and things
