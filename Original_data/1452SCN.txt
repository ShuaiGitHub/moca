1452SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - twice a day he plays skillfully and with a zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged to walk more . and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern . in his language .
