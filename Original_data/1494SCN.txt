the grandfather passage . 
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 
never heard that ah . expression in my life
