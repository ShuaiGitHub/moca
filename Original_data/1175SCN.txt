Interviewer 1175SCN: now tell me about an early happy childhood memory .

1175SCN: well we were living in Ashburton and we had an old nineteen twenty eight
Buick and old square car and we set off on family holidays one summer 
to go to Lake Ohau and down to Wanaka and so forth .
and I remember we packed up the big old army bell tent we had on the back and we had
. food and other stuff packed in t-shirts on the back and stuff along the running boards and
. I carved a big wooden propeller and put it on the front of the car and so we 
drove off across the Canterbury plains with the propeller going round and round and round . 
ah it was absolutely superb um . Lake Ohau when we first stopped was a lovely quiet place
beside the lake absolutely tranquil in those days .
we put the tent up and got organised for the night . 
and ah it was getting dark and a couple of blokes came walking up .
the road and said we've got stuck we tried to ford the little creak down the road and got stuck so . 
we tossed the two girls who were in the back of the car out and then I went off with the car to pull them out .
they had a tow rope so we took that from the back of the old Buick round the bumper bar of their car and 
pulled the bumper off to my delight . but on a second attempt we got them out . 
so ah that was one of the the glorious memories of my youth 
and wake up in the morning and seeing the sun light hills on the other side of the lake lovely .

Interviewer 1175SCN: oh thank you . ah what did you have for breakfast 

1175SCN: I had muesli with stewed apple . and milk .

Interviewer 1175SCN: what do you like best for breakfast .

1175SCN: muesli with stewed apple and milk or muesli and fruit generally . 

Interviewer 1175SCN: oh well we're nearly done um you ok?

1175SCN: yeah absolutely 

Interviewer 1175SCN: alright um could you read this passage please

1175SCN: certainly

Interviewer 1175SCN: it's not a test of reading skills so you might like to look through it first 

1175SCN: fine

Interviewer 1175SCN: otherwise

1175SCN: ah no problems <when you're ready> we l~ 
 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language about eighty years out of date but never mind 

Interviewer 1175SCN: alright well we're done that went ok didn't it 

1175SCN: ok well that was remarkably simple

Interviewer 1175SCN: mmm . so which test was the hardest . 

1175SCN: oh I think the recalling of words <mmm> ah my memory's not brilliant and I k~ I use paper a lot to jot things down
keep sequences and get organised - but ah . y~
