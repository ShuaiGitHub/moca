1471SCN: the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the . snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short work .
walk in the open air each day .
we often urge him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer (Anne): thank you right we've finished the recording that went okay didn't it? 

1471SCN: mm 

Interviewer (Anne): so . which test was the hardest? -
