 you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever   he
 he dresses himself in . old black . frock coat usually with several buttons missing .   a
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .   except
 except in the winter when the snow and ice prevents he 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language
