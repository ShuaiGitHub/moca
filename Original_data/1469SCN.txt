1469SCN: oh yes <yip> I can think of something funny . I used to go up to an uncle's farm
at Motu which lies between ah Gisbourne and Opotiki . up in the . hill country there .
and um he had horses . and we used to ride horses and I used to ride a horse called Podge .
and Podge was very headstrong and um -
very difficult to catch and saddle up 
and ah the horse paddock was fairly close to where my aunty had a clothes line . 
can I swear <yeah> and um . 
I chased this horse round and round the paddock and in the 
end I said you fucking ba~ old bastard I'll give you a hiding if I catch hold of you and I finally got him and 
rode down to the house and my aunty said you've got a great command of the English language - 
and I said where were you and she said I was hanging washing out and I heard 
what you wre calling Podgey

Interviewer (Anne): and what do you like best for breakfast? - 

1469SCN: um probably that I like a 
fry up but it's not good for you so I don't have it very often I usually just have it when my son comes over 
for the holidays or something like that yeah - 

Interviewer (Anne): okay we're nearly finished are you okay? <yeah> --
this um passage here which I'd like you to read . 
um it's not test of reading skill <mhmm> so you might like to have a look at it first . 
just let me know when you're ready to read it aloud . 

1469SCN: mm . you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard .clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer (Anne): thank you . so we've finished the recording <mhmm> that went okay didn't it? <yip> 

1469SCN: that's quite a smart wee machine isn't it?

1469SCN: um - oh remembering that um diagram probably mm 

Interviewer (Anne): the recall of that <mm mm mm> complicated one mm
