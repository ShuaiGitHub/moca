Interviewer 1118SCN: could you now tell me about an early childhood memory --

1118SCN: I used to . steal . dog biscuits . um through a slat fence . 
the dog was fed on the other side of the . pet garden fence . um by the next door neighbour . and ah . 
I used to reach through and pinch the biscuits and munch them on my side . 
ah of the fence um with impunity until one day the instead of - standing around and barking at me through the fence 
ah as previously the dog headed off . down to the bottom of the garden . and . 
to my horror I saw that the bottom of one of the palings was broken off and there was a hole and the dog knew all about it . 
and came at me with a rush and I . ran for my life . to . towards the house and scrambled in through . 
an window which . fortunately was open because it was the middle of summer . 
and that's 

Interviewer 1118SCN: excellent . could you tell me a little bit about your family . 

1118SCN: ah the family I come from or the family that I~ I've I've made 

Interviewer 1118SCN: um both 

1118SCN: the family I've come from um . well as I mentioned before there were six of us children <mm> . ah there's my . 
ah . eldest one Sheila . who is the matriach of the family now still . ah still alive and . the . 
yeah the lynchpin of the whole family . 
sh's a widow now but she lives by herself um in the house that she shared with her husband . and her children . 
two of the children live in walking distance of her and keep an eye on her . 
. um . the next eldest was Robert . Robert was an artist he taught at the Royal College of Art . sculptor . 
um . Robert . died towards the end of last year . the first of us to go . um - 
the . next one was Brian Brian was a . Wing Commander in the air force . ah he's retired now lives in the new forest . 
um - ah in a beautiful . home living a really quiet life . the next child was Jean
Jean . was a beauty . still is ah still a a knock out . um . and - 
Jean . had the good sense to have all daughters and all her daughters are beautiful so she's . she's got what . 
ah she's got five . five daughters . um and they're lovely <yip> 
I'm the next in order I'm there and below me there's . Mack Malcolm is really his name . 
Mack is three years younger than me ah he's now retired ah lives in the Cotswolds . in England half of the year . excuse me 
um . and the other half the year he spends in Perth Australia <oh right> . ah they emigrated to Australia on a scheme he and his wife . 
um and she got homesick ha~ at the end of two years <yip> and so they broke . 
their bond <oh I see> and returned to England and . now they can't go back permanently . 
to Australia although they own a house there . <oh okay> so he goes for what Australian law will allow half the year . 
and then back to the Cotswolds which is a very expensive way of living to fly backwards and forwards <yip> every year . 
ah so that's who we are . um . my children ah . I had five children my . my first wife . um -- 
Christian's the eldest he ah . teaches ah at . ah the Tech . ah he teaches art um - - 
and ah . he he's married lives in Lyttleton in the old . convent there . um . 
and he has one precious little son um . who is the light of their lives . ah . 
after Christian . comes Michael Michael - dropped out of the family for two or three years when he became involved with . 
ah a church that cast out ah non . members um so he didn't . speak to us or contact us . for years um - 
until they there was a an internal revolution . <mhmm> ah in the church and things returned to a more normal basis <mhmm> um when he . 
immediately contacted us again he'd missed us . <mhmm> um . 
in the meantime he had ah picked up a wife . chosen for him by the church . <oh right> and ah . he's had . 
by the time he came back into our lives he had two . daughters . now he's got a son . 
ah as well so . ah it's a working marriage anyway . um - after him is . 
Malcolm or Callum Callum . is in - ah England now but he lived a lot of his life in Eastern Europe . he was in Hungary for . 
I don't know how many years <mhmm> um . speaks Hungarian like a Hungarian . um. but he . speaks Czech and Slovak as well <mhmm> 
can get by in German he's obviously . <bit of a linguist> another linguist yip . yip . oh he's a he's a business man now he's um - 
after doing various things working for record companies and this and that . <yip> um . and after yeah after all his years in Hungary and y~ . 
a year maybe two years in Romania where his . wife was born . um -- 
but that wasn't looking very promising on the business front . they went over um . and they 
a friend of his from the old Hungarian days . um has got a a business . recently set up in in . ah London . 
and ah he put . Callum in charge of it and ah . he is now the f~ fully fledged business man ah . very efficient . um . I - 
a very caring son um . he's the furthest from me but he's the one who - 
keeps in touch most I think ah Michael Michael comes round every . second Sunday or something um he's lovely . 
um - 
so that's those were the boys and then we had two girls . Katrina - ah Katrina - - 
trained as an Orientalist couldn't get a job as an Orientalist 
so she . works ah in the university up in Auckland in ah . tutoring . and she she writes . um . 
language exercise she's a . Japanese speaker . um -- 
and an ah anthropology major too <mhmm> um - and - 
so she's up there she has a little girl um she she's married at last . ah it's a beautiful little girl . 
ah very talented . um --
and . then there was the the tail end of my family who is Fiona - 
Fiona and her mother didn't hit it off - and ah sh~ . she has gradually . 
drifted away from the the main line of the . the family <mhmm> it's got to the the point where . um . 
we make a date to meet sort of twice a year for a catch up <yup> she's in Christchurch . um 
but she is is in Christchurch I'm out at South Brighton and we just . our paths don't cross . 
ah the other children ah I bump into in Christchurch occasionally . 
um and ah ther~ there's no there's no war going on but ah . she's . 
she doesn't feel like part of the . bunch and I'm afraid it was her mother that made her feel that way 
<mm okay> she was the odd one out <mm black sheep> yip . 
um so those those are mine and then there's my two inherited ones from my second wife <yeah> 
um when we got married she had a a son . Anton and a daughter Sam . <mhmm> um . 
they are . in middle age now um where they were Sam was . this big when we married um . Sam's the one 
who has Hepatitis C <yip> . 
ah Anton lives round the corner from his mother . um . 
and . is . a very staunch supporter . um and um belatedly . ah . Anton and his tiny wife . 
Anton is sort of six foot three <oh right has a tiny wife> and has a tiny wife <often happens> . pretty um . 
so . yeah . they have ah one son who is a bit hyperactive but ah . the apple of their eye 
ah so that's that's who we are we tend to run to families <yip> um . though . Christian and ah Katrina were late starters <yip>

: -- 

1118SCN: okay 
the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language - 

Interviewer 1118SCN: brilliant thank you - all right so we're done <thank you> it went okay didn't it ? 

1118SCN: yes it did um yeah and yes I had my m~ hole in memory just at the appropriate moment . mhmm

1118SCN: confusing the <the that drawing> the diagram <yip> 

Interviewer 1118SCN: it's quite hard we don't tell you to remember it <that's right> so 
it is hard just to see what sticks in the head <mm> . okay so thank you very much . um
