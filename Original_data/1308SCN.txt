I really enjoyed my . uncles um and my cousins and ah -- cos my mother came from . a farming . 
family . and she had ah six brothers and one sister so ah I had plenty of . 
farms at one stage I had fourteen cousins farming in Southland . so ah . 
I had a a reasonable exposure to the farming industry down there .

when I was probably ah in my early teens would have been ah . out on my uncle's farm with my cousin

1308SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all ab~ about my grandfather
well . he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clin~ clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully - and - with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter . when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . 
gra~ grandfather likes to be modern in his language -- <great>
