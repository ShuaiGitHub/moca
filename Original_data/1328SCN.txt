1328SCN: right the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced 
feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest 
upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we often we have often urged him to w~ walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
