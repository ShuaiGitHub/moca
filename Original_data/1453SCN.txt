1453SCN: right well my wife and I are civil defence . responders <uh huh> 
and we went to a meeting where there were a whole lot of new people and they were
being intoduced round the table . and the woman next to me . 
reeled off all the things she was involved in . and she was so busy that her brother-in-law .
termed her a domestic goddess . so when it came to my turn I'd just retired for the second time .
and I said ah well I'm a domestic god and I said I must be cos every time I get near
Sally these days she says 'god what do you want now' 
and that's genuine 

Interviewer 1453SCN: oh that's lovely um . is it possible just to recollect something from a long time ago
um . more childhood when you were about between nine and twelve just a um . just a story from your childhood .
<ah> it can be funny or otherwise 

1453SCN: right um . well I remember ah - I went to Heaton Intermediate
and I'd always played rugby . but my class teacher had been a New Zealand University's hockey rep 
and my brother also did play hockey he's a lot older than me . so I switched to playing hockey .
and ah . when I went to the first hocky practice . I . complained about the goal because . 
I thought it should have the same sort of pattern . as the rugby goal posts . 
and my teacher actually said 'well you don't flick it over the bar you put it under the bar' .
he was a very nice man actually 

Interviewer 1453SCN: oh thank you gorgeous ah what did you have for breakfast? . 

1453SCN: ah I started with a cup of tea while I got the breakfast . cos I'm the main cook . 
um . I had . one and a half weet-bix . a dessert spoon of raw oats . 
sliced almonds banana . chinese gooseberry . and raisins soya milk . 
and then a piece of toast half of which was marmite and the other half was honey .

1453SCN: yeah mmm . 

Interviewer 1453SCN: just have this passage here which I'd like you to read .
it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first .
just um let me know when you're ready to read it aloud 

1453SCN: yeah I'm right

Interviewer 1453SCN: ok 

1453SCN:  the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air every day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 

Interviewer 1453SCN: thank you alright we're . finished the recording that went ok didn't it?

1453SCN: yes as far as I'm concerned it did

1453SCN: yeah the complicated . figure
