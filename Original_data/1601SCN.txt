he would come and Jim'd say . oh hello Alaistar how are you tonight . um . goodbye Ben when he went . and he always got his . 
na~ and that has been a family joke Stewart comes in now we say oh hello Christopher . yes . so that was always a family joke 
but yeah funny things happen to my children all the time . 

JW: do you have another example? .

1601SCN: um - our . son . when he was a little boy . <mmm> told his grandmother . that smoking was bad for her . that she would die . 
<mmm> if she continued smoking . and she said yes I know dear but I've been smoking since I was sixteen and you know . 
and she immediately put her cigarette out in the ashtray . <mmm> unbeknown to us he picked it up and we found him in the garage smoking it .
sitting . right by the car . <yip> um and we . we said well you know you smoking there you could blow the car up 
but after telling grandma she could die he thought he would have a wee go

JW: yip <mmm> well I suppose . well . yeah . she was alright <that's right> 

1601SCN: but none of my children smoked 

JW: oh that's good how many children do you have? <I had>

1601SCN: four. two <mmm> g~ oh well I had . two girls . and two boys but . then I had two extras because my sister died at a young age 
leaving <oh I'm sorry> two children . so we had her two children . until . and I must indicate that . the children had a rotten father . 
um . until . my my parents went to court . er to try and adopt them <mmm> . owing to the fact that they were . older <mmm>
the court allowed them t~ allowed my parents to adopt the girl <mmm> . so they adopted her and brought her up . 
<mmm> she knew that they were nan and grandad <mmm> . um . and we had the boy until one day his father came and took him <mmm> . 
so he went to live with his father and we never saw him again until one day there was a knock on the door . 
and I opened the door and here was this . curly headed man and he said . Aunty Jean I'm sixteen I'm allowed to live where I like and I've come back home

JW: . oh that's lovely <so he>

1601SCN: came back home . mmm <oh I'm glad> mmm . 

JW: oh thank you so much for that story . . what did you have for breakfast?

1601SCN: breakfast this morning I had horrible porridge . can't stand it . I usually have fruit but we were in such a rush and Jim made porridge and dished some
. so I ate it . reluctantly . and toast . but one slice 

JW: and what do you like best for breakfast? . 

1601SCN: oh fruit . yeah . 

JW: I do too

1601SCN: yeah 

JW: um . well we're nearly finished . are you okay?

1601SCN: good as gold thank you . 

JW: well . could you read . this . passage please . now it's not a test of reading skill so you might like to look at it first . 
and just let me know when you're ready to read it . aloud - - 

1601SCN: oh that looks alright mmm . okay . 

JW: mmm just when you're ready . 

1601SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
banana oil that's a new one <banana oil> . 

JW: well we have finished the recording . it went okay didn't it? - so which test have you found the hardest? .

1601SCN:  excuse me the drawing ones 

JW: well thank you very much for that <>
