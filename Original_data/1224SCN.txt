1224SCN: the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he's nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clinging to his chin . giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with a zest upon a small organ . except in winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes .
a short walk in the open air each day - we have often . urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil - 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 
what a lovely piece <I know isn't it funny> . 

Interviewer 1224SCN: it's so funny I think um . it's designed so that you have to say . lots of different <yes> um like . zest . and . <mmm> um . 
old black frock coat .

1224SCN: er the figure ones <yip > are the always the hardest <yip> with me yip . 
<yeah that's what most people say> I used to . yes . er fortunately you had no spelling ones cos <ahh yeah> 
<> I am the world's worst speller . oh - the thing is people say about spelling . 
oh you should have a dictionary . but if you don't know how the word <> is spelled . how can you look it up in a dictionary? <exactly> 

Interviewer 1224SCN: and then um with English you can't always sound it out . <no> cos . English is a <mmm> non-sensical language <mmm> .

1224SCN: it's ver~ . I think . if . I'd been of this generation they would have discovered this dyslexic <ahh> . sorta thing <yeah> 
cos I do often get - the letters all right but they're not in the right order <right order . yip> . and um . 
I understand I'm much better verbally than I am . written down <yeah . yeah> so fortunately I married someone . 
who . could write down things <who proof proof reads it> very much so . 
and the spell checker went on the computer <ahh> and oh . <> but then you can put a word in . that they say okay but it's not really 
<oh okay> the word that you were wanting <yip> 

Interviewer 1224SCN: so it autocorrects it <mmm> . to something else . yeah . oh I . I don't like the spell checker I try and do it myself but um . 
<oh> I often I'm bad typer so . it ends up being gobbledy gook <yeah I'm not a big um> <no it's the>
