<wow> and my - old . cousin I think it was - 
leaning over and looking at me .

not moody but um --
possibly a bit quick tempered -- 

Interviewer 1006SCN: <um> sounds like all the females in my family <yes> --

1006SCN: there was one incident when she wouldn't talk . 
to anybody so father took us out for a drive in the car . 
to see if that would alleviate the syst~ . situation - 
we went up onto the hills . 
and she finally said I've got to go to the toilet - 
so and there was a -
convenience up on the hill . so she rushed up to that . 
came back and said it was the men's . 
then then she came out of it .

Interviewer 1006SCN: just needed that situation <mm> 
maybe she did something a bit silly . to get her out of her mood <mm> .

almost getting there it gets a bit long towards the end 
um . okay so I'll get you to read this passage . 
um it's not a test of reading skills so you're allowed to take as long as you want to to read through it and .
um get familiar with what you have to say . um and then whenever you are ready um you can just recite it

1006SCN: okay <yip> the grandfather passage - 
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well . he is nearly ninety years old . sorry ninety three years old - 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat - 
usually with several buttons missing - 
a long beard clings to his chin . 
giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents -
he slowly takes a short walk in the . open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . 
but he answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language 
quite delightful

Interviewer 1006SCN: excellent
it is isn't it 
okay so we're done <mm> that went okay didn't it <yes> yeah excellent .

Interviewer 1006SCN: yes . I know um we always get people in here and they say 
oh that that complex figure that you made me draw <mm> that was horrible that's that's our most common response to that question
excellent . okay I'll push st~
