Interviewer 1034SCN: very good . okay - can you now tell me about an early childhood memory --

1034SCN: goodness gracious now . I've so many . ah where do I start -
I used to live on a farm . and we . had horses my father was mad on horses .
so we had every sort of horse you could think of and we rode to school bareback on ponies <oh wow> and .
my earliest m~ one of my earliest memories is . sitting on the side of the hill waiting for . my older . sister . 
sisters and brother to come home from school on the pony . so I could get hold of the pony and get on it . bareback . 
and go out with my father and he'd lead me . while he was riding his horse over the farm is that enough ? .

Interviewer 1034SCN: yip um can you tell me a little bit more about your family . 

1034SCN: well I was one of fou~ I am one oh we lost one last year that's a brother . <mm>
we w~ had . I was one of four <mhmm> three girls and a boy . and as I say we were on a farm .
and we were very farmy people . and lots of animals <yeah> and worked on the farm because of the depression we w~ my father had bought a farm . 
a big place . and he'd had . um not a hell of a lot of money he'd lost his leg at the first world war . <oh okay> 
above the knee . and he started farming at Omarama well no sane person . with one leg . would try and . 
farm at Omarama in those days you didn't have cars to r~ ah vehicles to ride round the farm or pos~ post hole diggers or anything . <yip>
but a~ the~ he was gutsy and and then . we . came down country as we called it onto a farm . where . he had employed . men .
and that was made it easier for him because he couldn't do a lot of the physical things himself you see <yeah> . 
but it was a big . place to manage and he payed a lot of money for it . in the boom period just equivalent to what we've had a while ago <yip> . 
and then . borrowed a lot of money from Wright Stevensons and they promised him when the mortgage ran out that was there <yeah> they would . renew it .
<oh right> by the time it came to be renewed Wright Stevensons was nearly broke . <oh no> and they couldn't afford to . so . 
we would have had to walk off or dad would . <oh> but however some man c~ miracle man came down from the government from Wellington <oh> 
rode dad took him out on th farm for about a week and rode round . inspired him to what a good farmer he'd been .
and I think the man . probably took pity on him <yeah> and he . agreed that they would lend him this money to get him through .
<oh wow> but he had a very . tough time 
and ah . he was an amazing man . really mm

1034SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clinging to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice every day he plays skilfully and with zest upon an o~ small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a walk . takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
