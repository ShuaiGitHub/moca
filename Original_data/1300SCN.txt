1300SCN:  the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black fruit . frock . coat . usually with several bus~ buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
