you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his sing h~ his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to w~ walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers . banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
