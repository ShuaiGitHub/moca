it's not a test of reading skill so you might want to have a look at it first and just . 
just start reading when you're ready 

1363SCN: oh yeah that's alright um 
the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather well 
he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a walk a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language

Interviewer 1363SCN: excellent . thank you . so . so that's every thing think we've finished the recording that went ok didn't it?
