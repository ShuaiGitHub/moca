well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin giving 
those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skilfully . and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prev~ prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
