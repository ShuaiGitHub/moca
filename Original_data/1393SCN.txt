well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
usually with several bu~ buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when he s~ when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
