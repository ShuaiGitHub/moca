the grandfather passage .
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well . he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him .
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice . prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we often have to urge him to work . walk more . and smoke less .
but he always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
