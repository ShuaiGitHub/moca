 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling 
 of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil
