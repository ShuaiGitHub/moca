 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in winter when he when the snow or ice prevents he slowly walks slowly takes a short walk 
 in the open air each day . we often urge him . we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less
