Anne: if nothing funny or amusing comes to mind just an anecdote from your childhood . would be great - just any little . story that you can recollect . 
perhaps school or . holidays or . friendships - - 

1625SCN: oh I can think about . er . s~ something that . my sister and I used to do we had to share a bed . at one stage in our lives because 
um that was the only furniture . that the family had . and . we would be put to bed in the evening and she was two years and four .
months younger than me . um . and . we wouldn't be ready for sleep quite clearly and we'd get . get under the bed covers and we'd 
giggle and push and shove and carry on . and um . yeah we just used to . get giggly giggly giggly really giggly . 
and actually I've remembered the rest of one story which dad used to tell and they must've nearly . busted themselves when they . 
when it happened . because Berryl and I were misbehaving and we were giggling we shoulda been getting off to sleep . 
and apparently dad came in and - m~ unbeknownst to either of us and he slapped my backside . and I came out from under the covers and made . 
saw his face and went . . he reckons the look on my face was something really . priceless . <oh> but we did

1625SCN:  - it's called the grandfather passage - you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old . 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing . 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him . a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
