you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old -
yet he still thinks as swif~ swiftly as ever --
he dresses himself in an old frock an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing
a long beard clings to his chin 
giving those who obse~ observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
but he always answers banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language
