1472SCN: when I was five I must have been five . cos my . oh . 
I'll come to my b~ my younger brother . ah when I was five . 
mum always said to us if you don't stop being naughty Father Christmas won't come --
and e~ she always said that and we knew that 
that Father Christmas would always come but this Christmas . 
we went out to the dining room we'd hung the stockings up the night before . 
along the fireplace and we went out and they were just empty against the fireplace .
and I've never forgotten the feeling it was just awful there was nothing in them . 
couldn't believe it <oh dear> and . 
eventually we saw a piece of paper . 
pinned to the fireplace . and . 
it said that we were going up to our grandparents' later in the day . 
and we were to go down into the garden . Grandma's home was on a hill and . 
go down into the garden below the hill 
lots of trees down there just go down there and you'll find that I've left you some . 
goodies there . so
we eventually got to grandma's and we went down the hill -
and my older brother and I could run fast and we just ran down the hill and . 
nothing there was nothing there either but my younger brother . who's two years younger than me 
he was much slower and he was very carefully looking round and he looked up the walnut tree .
and it was absolutely covered I can still see the walnut tree too .
it had - balloons . decorations . presents galore . it was wonderful

Interviewer (Simon): oh right 

1472SCN: I've never forgotten it <wow> it was just so beautiful 
you know it really was and we'd been so disappointed and we were sure that . 
we'd been impossibly naughty you know . but -
two days later . I'd had another brother .
<oh right> of course I didn't know mum was pregnant 
you didn't know your mother was pregnant in those days <yip 
<oh dear> you know and I suppose she thought .
she mightn't have made it g~ for Christmas <right wow> but 
but two days later he was born <is that right> but it was . 
it's a Christmas I'll never forget because I can still s~ feel the awfulness of looking at that fireplace .
nothing there and then that wonderful walnut tree

1472SCN: -- 
 mm . you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (Simon): excellent thank you very much . 

1472SCN: he sounds like a very nice grandfather 

Interviewer (Simon): he does doesn't he
