you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old yet .
he still thinks as swiftly as ever he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his che~ chin . giving those who observe him .
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in winter when the snow or ice . prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he a~ always answers . banana oil .
grandfather likes to be . modern in his language -
