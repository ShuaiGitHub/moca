day when all the visitors came to . give their . <mmm> sympathy to my mother and father .
I can remember things like that in those days I can remember the . horse . drawn - -
cart on which the local power board or whoever it was I don't know who they were . 
used to have a brazier hanging behind it and heated up their soldering iron in it to do the repairs for the overhead wires
you wouldn't believe it . I can remember getting into a . a ah . gig my mother's brother had a farmlet out . 
Prebbleton I think it was . or Ladbrooks and ah he c~ pulled up at the p~ at our place in the horse and gig
and we all hopped into this . two wheeled gig . and took us out to the farm 
so I can remember those sort of things . but ah and I can remember being shot in the head 
which is interesting . with a air air pistol . we we <goodness> i~ i~ my father was a war vetern . 
and he taught us to use air rifels very e~ e~ very early I was at primary school probably in . 
second to last year cos I had a brother who was two years ahead of me . 
and he was still at primary school - and ah . we learnt to shoot with those air rifels 
and of course we misbehaved with them we shot birds we b~ I I was a better shot than he was and I 
becomed I became a . a marksman . in in later life . ah . and ah ah ah . 
we had fights over in the paddocks the other side of of Rutland Street it was all countrifed then
and I remember this bloke up the tree . with his . tw~ point two two air pistol .

1570SCN: yeah - 

Interviewer 1570SCN: just like . got this passage here um that I'd like you to read please 

1570SCN: you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be modern in his language -

Interviewer 1570SCN: great thank you . we've finished the recording that went ok didn't it

Interviewer 1570SCN: yeah . 

1570SCN: <that's the hardest one> there are there are d~ the ones that impress on my mind we nearly lost our son over in Rarotonga
he damn near drowned . and ah . that impressed me and I can remember that to this day 
stricking out to get him and one of the locals got to him first fortunately . 
<goodness> that was in a pool which had no bottom there were some odd things over in the islands 
where the water just goes right down you know there there's not known bottom <goodness>
