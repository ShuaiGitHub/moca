1129SCN: okay the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin giving those who obs~ observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect 
twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day 
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
