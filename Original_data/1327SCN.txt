so I shouted her to weight watchers .

1327SCN: I'll just read it 
the grandfather passage you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks av~ as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard cli~ clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced 
feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents . 
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers 
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1327SCN: thank you . right so we've finished that recording now that went ok didn't it?
