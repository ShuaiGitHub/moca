1491SCN: grandfather passage - 
you wish to know all about my grandfather 
well he is nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself . in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing .
a long . beard clings to his . chin -
giving those who observe him .
a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully .
and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slo~ . 
slowly takes a short walk . in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more 
and smoke less but he always answers banana oil .
grandfather likes to be . modern in his language -
