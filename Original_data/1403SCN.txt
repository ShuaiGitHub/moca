1403SCN: the grandfather passage -
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old - 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever - 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing - 
 a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except when the winter when the snow or ice prevents him slowly . 
 he slowly takes a walk in the open air each day - 
 we often urge him to walk more and smoke less . 
 but he always answers banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language 

Interviewer (AH): thank you . so we've finished the recording . it went okay didn't it? 

1403SCN: great . oh just a wee bit of the story that er walking bit was a bit odd wasn't it I didn't get that quite right .
we we ask him to walk more <yip> in the winter but he he slows is it
