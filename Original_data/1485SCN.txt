which gave good exercise - 
I taught in the country for three years and .

1485SCN: that's okay <yip>
you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he's nearly ninety three years old .
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever -
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing -
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect -
twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ -
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents .
he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day -
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil -
grandfather likes to be modern in his language
never heard that . expression before 

Interviewer (AH): so we're nearly fi~ so we've finished the recording it went okay didn't it?

1485SCN: yes

Interviewer (AH): cool um so which test did you find the hardest? -- 

1485SCN: oh there was one I couldn't remember wasn't there 
yes that would be the hardest I can't remember what it was 

Interviewer (AH): okay um . I need to turn that off
