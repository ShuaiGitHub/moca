usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who obser~ who observe him a 
pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
we have often urged to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers . banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language -
