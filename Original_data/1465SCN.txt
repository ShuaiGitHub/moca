1465SCN: the grandfather passage 
 you wish to know all about my grandfather 
 well he is nearly ninety three years old 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing 
 a long beard clings to his chin 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents 
 he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language . 
banana oil .
