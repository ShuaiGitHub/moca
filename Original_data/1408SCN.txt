well he is nearly ninety three years old . yet he still thinks as swif~ swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin . giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
