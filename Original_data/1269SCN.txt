Interviewer 1269SCN: ah so it's not a test of reading skill or anything like that so if you wish you can read through that . um
yourself first and when you're ready just read that aloud . 

1269SCN: right - - like now do you mean . ok .
 you wish to know all about my grandfather . well he is nearly ninety three years old . 
 yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . he dresses himself in an old black frock coat . 
 usually with several buttons missing . a long beard clings to his chin . 
 giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect - 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ - 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day - 
 we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less . but he always answers banana oil 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language that's funny
