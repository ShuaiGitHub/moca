Interviewer 1093SCN: um can you now tell me about an early childhood memory ? . 

1093SCN: an early childhood memory was ah almo~ ah well it wasn't a memory really it's a story . 
<mhmm> I was almost run over at the age of three by my father with a tractor 
and my brother fortunately shouted in time and missed and broke my collar bone
but no idea how it broke my collar bone without breaking my head <oh no> but anyway that's what happened so I'm still here <excellent>

Interviewer 1093SCN: we have um one of my f~ family members was the same thing happened their father accidentally ran them over but they were not so fortunate <mm> 
yeah so tell me about y~ tell me about your grandfather what's the family history you're . putting together 

1093SCN: oh my grandfather e~ um emigrated from Ireland a place called . 
ah Corcreeny . he was born I think in Warringstown which is just south of Lochnae or Lurgan . um . 
they boarded the Zealandia ah in June eighteen sixty two and took a hundred and ten days to get to Christchurch - 
a~ um . he w~ what was he then he was about the age of . four I think at that point then he went to ah . 
the family went and lived in Akaroa where his father worked as a sawmiller and bushman . and then they moved 
to Loburn just north of Rangiora . um - and my great grandfather was going to buy the . 
the square what is now called the Christchurch square but it was too swampy so he decided Loburn would be better so they moved to Loburn 
and basically lived their whole life there having a further um . 
total of twelve children n~ a further nine children and they lived at Loburn <busy people> yeah an~ and those children basically spread out through 
ah north Canterbury <yeah> a few a bit further south but mostly north Canterbury <yeah wow> mm

Interviewer 1093SCN: yeah it's quite <yeah> funny oh well not really funny but um how . only now we realise that it probably wasn't a good idea to build . a city on a swamp

1093SCN: no no it's taken a while to find out <lasted a long time> yeah . 

Interviewer 1093SCN: lasted a while . thank you . what did you have for breakfast ? 

1093SCN: oh porridge I usually have porridge with ah . 
with linseed which I put in a coffee grinder and beat it up cos I've been told that the linseed doesn't digest 
goes through the human sys~ digest well in the human system <oh okay> so you have to <grind it> break up the grains <yeah> so 
my w~ wife bought a cof~ coffee grinder because she accidentally bought ground coffee instead of plunger coffee 
unground coffee so she bought a got a coffee grinder <I've done that before> and I find it works perfectly for the linseed 

Interviewer 1093SCN:  <so> oh good she'll have slightly linseed flavoured coffee now 

1093SCN: yes that's oh well no she doesn't doesn't use it now <oh that's good> I use it <I'll remember that one> 

Interviewer 1093SCN: so what do you like best for breakfast ? 

1093SCN: ah breakfast with porridge <porridge> it's about all I have I've <oh yeah> so~ I occa~ usually have a s~ have a f~
bit of fruit afterwards if I'm away I might have ah weetbix or weetbix and fruit or something of that sort <yeah> but certainly not back to the old . 
bacon eggs and . ah bacon eggs and chops and everything that we used to have <yeah> as as a youth <yeah> that's for sure 

Interviewer 1093SCN: that's what we used to have every . um every weekend . bacon and eggs and sausages <yip> 
all right so we're nearly finished <yip> are you okay <yip> excellent so the last thing that um . we basically need to do is 
have a look at this grandfather passage <all right> 
so um this is not a test of reading skill so um 
feel free to read through it and get familiar with it and whenever you are ready just um recite it out loud and it will be recorded --
-- 

1093SCN: no he doesn't --
-- 
 the grandfather passage . you wish to know all about my grandfather . well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever . 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of ut~ the utmost respect . 
 twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ . 
 except in the winter when the ice snow or ice prevents . he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day . 
 we have often wor~ urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers banana oil - 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1093SCN: so we're done <excellent> yip that went okay didn't it ? <yip> so which test was the hardest ?
