you wish to know all about my grandfather .
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever .
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat usually with several buttons missing .
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect .
twice each day . he plays skilfully and with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when snow or ice prevents he slowly 
takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we h~ we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less but he always answers .
banana oil . grandfather likes to be modern in his language .
