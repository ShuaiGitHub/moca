the grandfather passage -
 you wish to know all about my grandfather well . 
 he is nearly ninety three years old yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
 he dresses himself in an old black frock coat 
 usually with several buttons missing . 
 a long beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling 
 of the utmost respect - 
 twice a day he plays skilfully and with zest . 
 upon a small organ 
 except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk 
 in the open air each day - 
 we have often we have often urged him to walk more and smoke less 
 but he always answers banana oil . 
 grandfather likes to be modern in his language-
