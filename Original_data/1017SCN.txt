Interviewer 1017SCN: um now tell me about an early childhood memory -- 

1017SCN: when we were five we shifted to live out at Paparua prison becasue dad became a prison officer . 
and I remember when we were actually moving house and all the furniture was going in . 
and the local children were in the - 
area where they have for a pit over the road and were all looking at us and . 
checking out who was moving in . probably because they were really keen to see who th~ was coming that they could play with .

the grandfather passage
you wish to know all about my grandfather . 
well he is nearly ninety three years old 
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever 
he dresses himself in an old black frock coat .
usually with several buttons missing 
a long beard clings to his chin .
giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of utmost respect .
twice each day he plays skilfully with zest upon a small organ .
except in the winter when the snow or ice prevents he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day .
we have often urged him to walk more . and smoke less .
but he always answers banana oil . 
grandfather likes to be modern in his language .

Interviewer 1017SCN: okay thank you 
um that recording went okay didn't it

1017SCN: yes <that was fine?> probably <okay>
