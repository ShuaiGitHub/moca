we used to ride down to the local river which was about four miles away on our very old bicycles and swim in the river in the Ashley river .
um and that was always an enjoyable activity
I had muesli and yoghurt and milk and two cups of tea
exactly what I said except I do like   I make bread and I like at the weekend to have two slices of my
bread toasted with marmalade
it's a treat
okay and . so we're nearly finished so are you okay ?
yes
