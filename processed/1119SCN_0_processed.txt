the war . sleeping in . air raid shelters . looking up at the sky
and seeing a red sky over London . being told it was the fires  
it's alright   be ok .   but that was my most vivid one .
um All Bran and banana and an egg . and um . Ryvita biscuit .
what do I like best I'm quite happy with that
yes .
