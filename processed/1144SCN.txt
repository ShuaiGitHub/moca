early happy childhood memory was running along the   the small concrete fence
. with my father's brand new eight millimeter   camera .
making a movie . of all my family .
for breakfast this morning I had a serving of rhubarb .
and I had a piece of toast . with a piece of last nights left over fish on it .
and a cup of coffee .
I like something savoury for breakfast  
ok we're nearly finished are you ok
yes I'm fine
thank you
