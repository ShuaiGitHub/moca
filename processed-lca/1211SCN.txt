I remember waking up   once when I was about   six .
and it was Christmas day . and it was a lovely sunny morning
and the Salvation Army band was across the road . playing carols .
and I thought what a lovely start to Christmas day  
today ?   I had a piece of toast and a cup of tea and a plate of . cereal and fruit .
that's what I like best  
yes
